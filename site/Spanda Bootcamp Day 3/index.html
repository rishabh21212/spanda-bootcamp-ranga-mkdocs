  <h1>Spanda Bootcamp Day 3</h1>

<p><strong>[Section 1:
Overview_____________________]{.underline}</strong></p>
<p><strong>Data Lakes, Federated Learning and Big Data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data Lakes as a concept have played a key role in ushering in the
    massive scales we see when working with data today as they give
    companies the ability to store arbitrary types of data observed
    during operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While this freedom allows data lakes to maintain the maximum
    potential of the data generated by the company, it also can lead to
    a key problem---complacency in understanding the collected data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ease of storing different types of data in an unstructured
    manner can actually lead to a <em>store now, sort out later</em> mentality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The true difficulty of working with unstructured data actually stems
    from its processing; thus, the delayed processing mentality has the
    potential to lead to data lakes that become highly cumbersome to
    sift through and work with due to unrestricted growth from the
    collection of data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raw data is only as valuable as the models and insights that can be
    derived from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The central data lake approach leads to cases where derivation from
    the data is limited by a lack of structure, leading to issues
    ranging from storage inefficiency to actual intelligence
    inefficiency due to extraction difficulties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other side, approaches preceding data lakes suffered from a
    simple lack of access to the amount of data potentially available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that Federated Learning (FL) allows for both classes of
    problems to be avoided is the key driving support for FL as the
    vehicle that will advance big data into the collective intelligence
    era.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This claim is substantiated by the fact that FL flips the big data
    flow from collect → derive intelligence to derive intelligence →
    collect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For humans, intelligence can be thought of as the condensed form of
    large swaths of experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a similar way, the derivation of intelligence at the source of
    the generated data--- done by training a model on the data at the
    source location---succinctly summarizes the data in a format that
    maximizes accessibility for practical applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The late collection step of FL leads to the creation of the desired
    global intelligence with maximal data access and data storage
    efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even cases with partial usage of the generated data sources can
    still greatly benefit from the joint storage of intelligence and
    data by greatly reducing the number of data formats entering the
    residual data lake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abundance, Acceptance &amp; Ambivalence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While many definitions have been proposed with emphasis on different
    aspects, Oxford professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger and <em>The
    Economist</em> senior editor Kenneth Cukier brilliantly elucidated the
    nature of big data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not about how big the data in a server is; <em>big data is about
    three major shifts of a mindset that are interlinked and hence
    reinforce one another</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their argument can be summarized as the <strong><em>Triple-A mindset for big
    data</em>*, which consists of an </strong>Abundance of observations<strong>,
    </strong>Acceptance of messiness<strong>, and </strong>Ambivalence of causality***.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abundance of observations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Big data doesn't <strong><em>have</em></strong> to be <em>big</em> in terms of columns and rows
    or file size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big data has a number of observations, commonly denominated as <em>n</em>,
    close or equal to the size of the population of interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In traditional statistics, collecting data from the entire
    population---for example, people interested in fitness in New
    York---was not possible or feasible, and researchers would have to
    randomly select a sample from the population---for example, 1,000
    people interested in fitness in New York.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Random sampling is often difficult to perform and so is justifying
    the narrow focus on particular subgroups: surveying people around
    gyms would miss those who run in parks and practice yoga at home,
    and why gym goers rather than runners and yoga fans?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks to the development and sophistication of <strong>Information and
    Communications Technology</strong> (<strong>ICT</strong>) systems, however, researchers
    today can access the data of <em>approximately all of the population</em>
    through multiple sources---for example, records of Google searches
    about fitness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This paradigm of <em>abundance</em> or <em>n = all</em> is advantageous since what
    the data says can be interpreted as a true statement about the
    population, whereas the older methods could only <em>infer</em> such truth
    with a significant level of confidence expressed in a <em>p-value</em>,
    typically supposed to be under 0.05.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small data provides statistics; big data proves states.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Acceptance of messiness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Big data is messy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we use Google search data as a proxy for someone's interest---for
    example---we could mistakenly attribute some of the searches made by
    their family or friends on their devices to them, and the estimated
    interest will be inaccurate to the degree of the ratio of such
    unowned-device searches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some devices, a significant amount of searches may be made by
    multiple users, such as shared computers at an office or a
    smartphone belonging to a child whose younger siblings are yet to
    own one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, people may search for words that pop up in a conversation
    with someone else, rather than self-talk, which does not necessarily
    reflect their own interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In studies using traditional methods, researchers would have to make
    sure that such devices are not included in their sample data because
    the <em>mess</em> can affect the quality of inference significantly, as the
    number of observations would be small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is not the case in big data studies. Researchers would be
    willing to <em>accept the mess</em> as its effect diminishes proportionally
    as the number of observations becomes large enough toward <em>n = all</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In most devices, Google searches would be made by the owner
    autonomously most of the time, and the impact of searches in other
    contexts would not matter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ambivalence of causality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Big data is often used to study <strong><em>correlation</em></strong> but not
    <strong><em>causation</em></strong>---in other words, it usually does not tell <em>why</em> but
    only <em>what</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For many practical questions, correlation alone can provide the
    answer. Mayer-Schönberger and Cukier give several examples in
    the <em>Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work,
    and Think</em> book, among which is Fair Isaac Corporation's <em>Medication
    Adherence Score</em> established in 2011.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an era where people's behavioral patterns are <em>datafied</em>,
    collecting <em>n = all</em> observations for the variables of interest is
    possible, and the correlation found among them is powerful enough to
    direct our decision-making. There is no need to know people's
    psychological scores
    of <em>consistency</em> or <em>conformity</em> that <em>cause</em> their adherence to
    medical prescriptions; by looking at how they behave in other
    aspects of life, we can directly predict whether they will follow
    the prescription or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By embracing the triple mindset of abundance, acceptance, and
    ambivalence, enterprises and governments have generated intelligence
    across tasks from pricing services to recommending products,
    optimizing transportation routes, and identifying crime suspects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nevertheless, that mindset has been challenged in recent years, as
    shown in the following sections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, let's glimpse into how the abundance of observations often
    taken for granted is currently under pressure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AI and Data Privacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FL is often said to be one of the most popular <strong><em>privacy-preserving
    AI technologies</em></strong> because <strong><em>private data does not have to be
    collected or shared with third-party entities to generate
    high-quality intelligence</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, in this section, we discuss the data privacy that has
    been a bottleneck that FL tries to resolve to create high-quality
    intelligence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data privacy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data privacy, also known as <em>information privacy</em>, is the <strong><em>right
    of individuals to control how their personal information is used,
    which mandates third parties to handle, process, store, and use such
    information properly in accordance with the law</em></strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In May 2021, HCA Healthcare announced that the company had
    struck a deal to share its patient records and real-time medical
    data with Google.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various media quickly responded by warning the public about the
    deal, as Google had been mentioned for its <em>Project
    Nightingale</em> where the tech giant allegedly exploited the
    sensitive data of millions of American patients.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given above 80% of the public believes that the potential risks in
    data collection by companies <strong><em>outweigh the benefits</em></strong>, according
    to a 2019 poll by Pew Research Center, data sharing projects of such
    a scale are naturally seen as a threat to people's <em>data privacy</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is often confused with <em>data security</em>, which ensures that data
    is accurate, reliable, and accessible only to authorized users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of Google accounts, data privacy regulates how the
    company can use the account holders' information, while data
    security requires them to deploy measures such as password
    protection and <strong>2-step verification</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In explaining these two concepts, the data privacy managers use an
    analogy of a <em>window</em> for security and a <em>curtain</em> for privacy: data
    security is a prerequisite for data privacy. Put together, they
    comprise <em>data protection</em>, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 1.2 -- Data security versus data privacy
" src="../images/media/image80.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="2.182638888888889in"}</p>
<p>Figure 1.2 -- Data security versus data privacy</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can see from the preceding diagram that while data security
    limits <em>who</em> can access data, data privacy limits <em>what</em> can be in
    the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding this distinction is very important because data
    privacy can multiply the consequences of failures in data security.
    Let's look into how.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Privata Data Risks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Failing in data protection is costly. According to IBM's <em>Cost of a
    Data Breach Report 2021</em>, the global average cost of a data breach
    in the year marked <strong>US dollars</strong> (<strong>USD</strong>) $4.24 million, which is
    considerably higher than $3.86 million a year earlier and is
    the highest amount in the 17-year history of the report; an
    increased number of people working remotely in the aftermath of the
    COVID-19 outbreak is considered a major reason for the spike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The top five industries for average total cost are healthcare,
    finance, pharmaceuticals, technology, and energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearly half of breaches in the year included customer <strong>personally
    identifiable information</strong> (<strong>PII</strong>), which costs $180 per record
    on average.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once customer PII is breached, negativities such as system downtime
    during the response, loss of customers, need for acquiring new
    customers, reputation losses, and diminished goodwill ensue; hence,
    the hefty cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The IBM study also found that failing to comply with regulations for
    data protection was top among the factors that amplify data breach
    costs
    (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/ojdvqgry">[https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/ojdvqgry]{.underline}</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Increased Data Protection Regulations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As technology advances, the need to protect customer data has become
    more critical. Consumers require and expect privacy protection
    during every transaction; many simple activities can risk personal
    data, whether online banking or using a phone app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governments worldwide were initially slow to react by creating laws
    and regulations to protect personal data from identity theft,
    cybercrime, and data privacy violations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, times are now changing as data protection laws are
    beginning to take shape globally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are several drivers for the increase in regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These include the growth of enormous amounts of data, and we need
    more data security and privacy to protect users from nefarious
    activities such as identity theft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's look at some of the <strong><em>measures taken toward data privacy</em></strong>
    in the following subsections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong>GDPR</strong>) by <strong>European
    Union</strong> is regarded as the first data protection regulation in the
    modern data economy and was emulated by many countries to craft
    their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GDPR was proposed in 2012, adapted by the EU Council and Parliament
    in 2016, and enforced in May 2018. It superseded the Data Protection
    Directive that had been adopted in 1995.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What makes GDPR epoch-making is its stress on the protection of PII,
    including people's names, locations, racial or ethnic origin,
    political or sexual orientation, religious beliefs, association
    memberships, and genetic/biometric/health information. Organizations
    and individuals both in and outside the EU have to follow the
    regulation when dealing with the personal data of EU residents.
    There are seven principles of GDPR, among which six were inherited
    from the Data Protection Directive; the new principle
    is <em>accountability</em>, which demands data users maintain documentation
    about the purpose and procedure of personal data usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GDPR has shown the public what the consequences of its violation can
    be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on the severity of non-compliance, the GDPR fine can go
    from 2% of global annual turnover or €10 million, whichever is
    higher, or 4% of global annual turnover or €20 million, whichever is
    higher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In May 2018, thousands of Europeans filed a complaint against
    Amazon.com Inc. through the French organization La Quadrature du
    Net, also known as <em>Squaring the Net</em> in English, accusing the
    company of using its advertisement targeting system without customer
    consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 3 years of investigation, Luxembourg's <strong>National Commission
    for Data Protection</strong> (<strong>CNDP</strong>) made headlines around the world: it
    issued Amazon a €746 million fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, WhatsApp was fined by Ireland's Data Protection
    Commission in September 2021 for GDPR infringement; again, the
    investigation had taken 3 years, and the fine amounted to €225
    million.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, in the US, a majority of states have privacy protections
    in place or soon will. Additionally, several states have
    strengthened existing regulations, such as California, Colorado, and
    Virginia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's look at each to get an idea of these changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The state of California followed suit. The <strong>California Consumer
    Privacy Act</strong> (<strong>CCPA</strong>) became effective on January 1, 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the name suggests, the aim of the regulation is to protect
    consumers' PII just as GDPR does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compared to GDPR, the scope of the CCPA is significantly limited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CCPA is applicable only to for-profit organizations that collect
    data from over 50,000 points (residents, households, or devices in
    the state) in a year, generate annual revenue over $25 million, or
    make half of their annual revenue by selling such information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, CCPA infringement can be much more costly than GDPR
    infringement since the former has no ceiling for its fine ($2,500
    per record for each unintentional violation; $7,500 per record for
    each intentional violation).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Colorado Privacy Act (CPA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under the <strong>Colorado Privacy Act</strong> (<strong>CPA</strong>), starting July 1, 2024,
    data collectors and controllers will have to follow universal
    opt-outs that users have selected for generating targeted
    advertising and sales. This rule protects residents in Colorado from
    targeted sales and advertising as well as certain types of
    profiling.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virginia's <strong>Consumer Data Protection Act</strong> (<strong>CDPA</strong>) will make
    several changes to increase security and privacy on January 1, 2023.
    These changes will be applicable to organizations that do business
    in Virginia or with residents in Virginia. Data collectors need to
    obtain approval to utilize their private data. These changes also
    try to determine the adequacy of privacy and security of AI vendors,
    which may require the removal of that data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are just a few simple examples of how data regulations will
    take shape in the US. What does this look like for the rest of the
    world? Some estimate that by 2024, 75% of the global population will
    have personal data covered by privacy regulations of one type or
    another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another example of major data protection regulation is
    Brazil's <strong>Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais</strong> (<strong>LGPD</strong>)
    which has been in force since September 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It replaced dozens of laws in the country related to data privacy.
    LGPD was modeled after GDPR, and the contents are almost identical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Asia, Japan was the first country to introduce a data protection
    regulation: the <strong>Act on the Protection of Personal
    Information</strong> (<strong>APPI</strong>) was adopted in 2003 and amended in 2015. In
    April 2022, the latest version of APPI was put in force to address
    modern concerns over data privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>FL has been identified as a critical technology that can work
    well with privacy regulations and regulatory compliance in different
    domains.</em></strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data Minimalism</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Organizations have been acclimatizing to these regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TrustArc's <em>Global Privacy Benchmarks Survey 2021</em> found that the
    number of enterprises with a dedicated privacy office is increasing:
    83% of respondents in the survey had a privacy office, whereas the
    rate was only 67% in 2020. 85% had a strategic and reportable
    privacy management program in place, yet 73% of them believed that
    they could do more to protect privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their eagerness is hardly surprising as 34% of the respondents
    claimed that they had faced a data breach in the previous 3 years,
    the costly consequences of which was mentioned previously Here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A privacy office would be led by a <strong>data protection
    officer</strong> (<strong>DPO</strong>) who is responsible for the company's <strong>Data
    Protection Impact Assessment</strong> (<strong>DPIA</strong>) in order to comply with
    regulations such as GDPR that demand accountability and
    documentation of personal data handling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DPOs are also responsible for monitoring and ensuring that personal
    data is treated by their organizations in compliance with the law,
    and the top management and board are supposed to provide necessary
    support and resources to DPOs to allow them to complete their task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the face of GDPR, the current trend in data protection is
    shifting toward <em>data minimalism</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data minimalism in this context does not necessarily encourage
    minimization of the size of data; it pertains more directly to
    <strong><em>minimizing PII factors</em></strong> in data so that individuals cannot be
    identified with its data points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, data minimalism affects AI sectors in their ability to
    create a high-performing AI application because a shortage in data
    variety for the ML process simply generates ML model biases with
    unsatisfying performance in prediction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The abundance mindset for big data introduced at the beginning of
    the section has thus been disciplined by the public concern over
    data privacy. The risk of being fined for violating data protection
    regulations, coupled with the wasteful cost of having a data
    graveyard, calls for practicing data minimalism rather than data
    abundance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is why FL is becoming a <em>must-have</em> solution for many AI
    solution providers such as medical sectors that are struggling with
    public concerns and data privacy, which basically becomes an issue
    when a third-party entity needs to collect private data for
    improving the quality of ML models and their applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As mentioned, FL is a promising framework for privacy-preserving AI
    because learning of the data can happen anywhere; even if the data
    is not available for the AI service providers, all we have to do is
    collect and aggregate trained ML models in a consistent way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, let's consider another facet of the Triple-A mindset for big
    data being challenged: acceptance of messy data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data Volume, Training Data and Model Bias</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does the sheer volume of big data truly annihilate the treacherous
    reality of <em>garbage in, garbage out</em>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, the messiness of data can only be accepted if enough data
    from a variety of sources and distributions can be fully learned
    <strong><em>without causing any biases in the outcomes of the learning</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The actual training of the big data in a centralized location does
    take a lot of time and huge computational resources and storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, we would probably have to find methods to measure and reduce
    model bias without directly collecting and accessing sensitive and
    private data, which would conflict with some of the privacy
    regulations discussed previously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL also has an aspect of distributed and collaborative learning,
    which becomes critical to eliminate data and model bias to absorb
    the messiness of the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With collaborative and distributed learning, we could significantly
    increase the data accessibility and efficiency of an entire learning
    process that is often very expensive and time-consuming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It gives us a chance to break through the limitation that big data
    training used to have, as discussed in the following sections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Training Costs</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>According to the report:
    https://www.flexera.com/blog/cloud/cloud-computing-trends-2022-state-of-the-cloud-report,
    37% of enterprises annually spend more than $12 million and 80%
    spend over $1.2 million per year for public cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The training cost over the cloud is not cheap, and it can easily be
    assumed that this cost is going to boost significantly, together
    with the increasing demand for AI and ML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, big data cannot be fully trained for ML because of the
    following issues:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   <strong>Big data storage</strong>: Big data storage is an architecture for
    compute and storage that collects and manages large amounts of
    datasets for AI applications or real-time analytics. Worldwide
    enterprise companies are paying more than $100 billion just for
    cloud storage and data center costs
    (https://a16z.com/2021/05/27/cost-of-cloud-paradox-market-cap-cloud-lifecycle-scale-growth-repatriation-optimization/).
    While some of the datasets are critical for the applications they
    provide, what they really want is often <strong>business
    intelligence</strong> that can be extracted from the data, not just the
    data itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Significant training time</strong>: Building and training an ML model
    that can be delivered as an authentic product basically takes a
    significant amount of time, not only for the training process but
    also for the preparation of the ML pipelines. Therefore, in many
    cases, the true value of the intelligence is going to be lost by the
    time the ML model is delivered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Huge computation</strong>: Training of an ML model often consumes
    significant computational resources. For example, an ML task of
    manipulating pieces such as a Rubik's Cube using a robotic hand
    could sometimes require more than 1,000 computers. It could also
    take a dozen machines just to run some specialized graphics chips
    for several months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communications latency</strong>: To form big data, especially in the
    cloud, a significant amount of data needs to be transferred to the
    server, which in itself causes communications latency. In most use
    cases, FL requires much less data to be transferred from local
    devices or learning environments to a server called an aggregator
    that is there to synthesize the local ML models collected from those
    devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: In traditional centralized systems, scalability
    becomes an issue because of the complexity of big data and its
    costly infrastructures such as huge storage and computing resources
    in the cloud server environment. In an FL server, only an
    aggregation is conducted to synthesize the multiple local models
    that have been trained to update the global model. Therefore, both
    the system and learning scalability increase significantly as ML
    training is conducted on edge devices in a distributed manner, not
    only in a single centralized learning server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-1-1" name="__codelineno-1-1" href="#__codelineno-1-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   FL effectively utilizes distributed computational resources that can
    be used for light training of the ML models.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whether training happens on actual physical devices or virtual
    instances of the cloud system, parallelizing the model training
    process into distributed environments often accelerates the speed of
    learning itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, once the trained models are collected, the FL system
    can quickly synthesize them to generate an updated ML model called a
    global model that absorbs enough learnings at the edge sides, and
    thus delivering the intelligence in near real time is possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Model bias and training data</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ML bias happens when an ML algorithm generates results that are
    systemically prejudiced because of erroneous assumptions in the ML
    process. ML bias is also sometimes called algorithm bias or AI bias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yann LeCun, the 2018 Turing Award winner for his outstanding
    contribution to the development of DL, says "<em>ML systems are biased
    when data is biased</em>"
    (<a href="https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1274782757907030016">[https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1274782757907030016]{.underline}</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This comes from a <strong>computer vision</strong> (<strong>CV</strong>) model trained with
    the Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset compiled by the Nvidia team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the face upsampling system, many people are classified
    as white as the network was pre-trained on Flickr-Faces-HQ data
    mainly containing pictures of white people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For this problem of misclassification of the people, the
    architecture of the model is not the issue that mandates this
    output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, the conclusion is that a racially skewed dataset generated a
    neutral model to produce biased outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Productive conversations about AI and ML biases have been led by the
    former lead of AI Ethics at Google.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 2018 publication of the <em>Gender Shades</em> paper demonstrated race
    and gender bias in major facial recognition models, and lawmakers in
    Congress have sought to prohibit the use of the technology by the US
    federal government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tech companies including Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft also agreed to
    suspend or terminate sales of facial recognition models to the
    police.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are encouraged to use an interventionist approach to data
    collection by advising scientists and engineers to specify the
    objectives of model development, form a strict policy for data
    collection, and conduct a thorough appraisal of collected data to
    avoid biases---details are available on the <em>FATE/CV</em> website
    (https://sites.google.com/view/fatecv-tutorial/home).</p>

<li>
<p>FL could be one of the most promising ML technologies to overcome
    data-silo issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very often, the data is not even be accessible or usable for the
    training, causing a significant bias in data and models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Naturally, FL is useful for overcoming bias by resolving the issues
    of data privacy and silos that become the bottleneck to
    fundamentally avoiding data bias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this context, FL is becoming a breakthrough in the implementation
    of big data services and applications, as thoroughly investigated
    in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04160.pdf">[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04160.pdf]{.underline}</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, there are several techniques that try to mitigate model bias
    in FL itself, such as <em>Reweighing</em> and <em>Prejudice Remover</em>, both
    detailed
    in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02447.pdf">[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02447.pdf]{.underline}</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Model drift &amp; performance degradation</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Model drift</em> is generally about the degradation of ML model
    performance because of changes in data and relationships
    between <strong>input and output</strong> (<strong>I/O</strong>) variables, known as <em>model
    decay</em>, as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model drift can be addressed by continuous learning to adapt to
    the latest changes in datasets or environments in near real time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the important aspects of FL is realizing a continuous
    learning framework by updating an ML model instantly whenever the
    learning happens in the local distributed environment anytime, in a
    consistent manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That way, FL could resolve the situation often seen in enterprise AI
    applications where the intelligence is useless by the time it is
    delivered for production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will now touch on how models could get degraded or stop working,
    and then some of the current efforts of <strong>model
    operations</strong> (<strong>ModelOps</strong>) to continuously improve the performance
    of models and achieve sustainable AI operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How models can stop working</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any AI and ML model with fixed parameters, or <em>weights</em>, generated
    from the training data and adjusted to the test data can perform
    fairly well when deployed in an environment where the model receives
    data similar to the training and test data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an autonomous driving model is well trained with data recorded
    during sunny daytime, the model can drive vehicles safely on sunny
    days because it is doing what it has been trained to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a rainy night, however, nobody should be in or near the vehicle
    if it is autonomously driven: the model is fed with totally
    unfamiliar, dark, and blurry images; its decisions will not be
    reliable at all. In such a situation, the model's decision will be
    far off the track, hence the name <strong>model drift</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, model drift is not likely to happen if the model is deployed
    in an environment similar to the training and testing environment
    and if the environment does not change significantly over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But in many business situations, that assumption does not always
    hold, and model drift becomes a serious issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are two types of model drifts: <strong>data drift</strong> and <strong>concept
    drift</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data drift happens when input data to a deployed model is
    significantly different from the data the model has been trained
    with. In other words, changes in <em>data distribution</em> are the cause
    of data drift. The aforementioned diurnal autonomous vehicle model
    not performing well in the nighttime is an example of data drift.
    Another example would be an ice-cream sale prediction model trained
    in California being deployed in New Zealand; seasonality in the
    southern hemisphere is opposite to that in the northern hemisphere,
    and the estimated sales of ice cream will be low for <em>summer</em> and
    high for <em>winter</em>, on the contrary to the actual sales volume.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concept drift, on the other hand, is a result of changes in how
    variables correlate with each other. In the terminology of
    statistics, this implies that the <em>data-generating process</em> has been
    altered. And this is what <strong>Google Flu Trends (GFT)</strong> suffered from,
    as the author of <em>The Undercover Economist</em> put it in the
    following <em>Financial Times</em> article:
    https://www.ft.com/content/21a6e7d8-b479-11e3-a09a-00144feabdc0#axzz30qfdzLCB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to the period, search queries were meaningfully correlated
    with the spread of flu as mainly people who suspected that they were
    infected typed those words in the browser, and therefore the model
    worked successfully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This may no longer have been the case in 2013 since people in other
    categories, such as those who were precocious about a potential
    pandemic or those who were just curious, were searching for those
    words, and they may have been led to do so by Google's
    recommendations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This concept drift likely made GFT overestimate the spread vis-à-vis
    medical reports provided by the <strong>Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention</strong> (<strong>CDC</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either by data or by concept, model drift causes model performance
    degradation, and it occurs because of our focus on correlation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>ground truth</em> in data science parlance does not mean something
    like the universal truth in hard science such as physics and
    chemistry---that is, causation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is merely a true statement about how variables in given data
    correlate with each other in a particular environment, and it
    provides no guarantee that the correlation holds when the
    environment changes or differs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is to say that what we estimate as the <em>ground truth</em> can vary
    over time and locations, just like the <em>ground</em> has been reshaped by
    seismic events throughout history and geography.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Continuous monitoring</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a survey commissioned by Redis Labs
    (https://venturebeat.com/business/redis-survey-finds-ai-is-stressing-it-infrastructure-to-breaking-point/),
    about half of the respondents cited model reliability (48%), model
    performance (44%), accuracy over time (57%), and latency of running
    the model (51%) as the top challenges for getting models deployed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given the risk and concern of model drift, AI and ML model
    stakeholders need to work on two additional tasks after deployment.
    First, model performance must be continuously monitored to detect
    model drift. Both data drift and concept drift can take place
    gradually or suddenly. Once model drift is detected, the model needs
    to be retrained with new training data, and when concept drift
    occurs, even the use of a new model architecture may be necessary to
    upgrade the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to address these requirements, a new ML principle
    called <strong>Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning</strong> (<strong>CD4ML</strong>) has
    been proposed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the framework of CD4ML,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A model is coded and trained with training data in the first
    step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The model is then tested with a separate dataset and evaluated
    based on some metrics, and more often than not, the best model
    is selected from multiple candidates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, the selected model is productionized with a further test
    to make sure that the model performs well after the deployment,
    and once it passes the test, it is deployed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, the monitoring process starts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When model drift is observed, the model will be retrained with
    new data or given a new architecture, depending on the severity
    of the drift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are familiar with software engineering, you might have
    noticed that CD4ML is the adoption of <strong>continuous
    integration/continuous delivery</strong> (<strong>CI/CD</strong>) in the field of
    ML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a similar vein, <em>ModelOps</em>, an AI and ML operational
    framework stemming from
    the <strong>development-operations</strong> (<strong>DevOps</strong>) software engineering
    framework is gaining popularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ModelOps bridges <strong>ML operations</strong> (<strong>MLOps</strong>: the integration
    of data engineering and data science) and application
    engineering; it can be seen as the enabler of CD4ML.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third factor of the <em>Triple-A mindset for big data</em> lets us
    focus on correlation and has helped in building AI and ML models
    rapidly over the last decade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding correlation is much easier than discovering causation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For many AI and ML models that have been telling us what we need to
    know from people's Google search patterns over years, we have to
    check if it still works today. And so do we tomorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is why FL is one of the important approaches for continuous
    learning. When creating and operating an FL system, it is also
    important to develop the system with ModelOps functionalities,
    as the critical role of FL is to keep improving models constantly
    from various learning environments in a collaborative manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is even possible to realize a <strong>crowdsourced learning</strong> framework
    with FL so that people in the platform can take the desired ML model
    to adapt and train it locally and return an updated model to the FL
    server with an aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With an advanced model aggregation framework to filter out poisonous
    ML models that could potentially degrade the current models, FL can
    consistently integrate other learnings, and thus realize a
    sustainable continuous learning operation that is key for the
    platform with ModelOps functionalities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The FL Solution Approach</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We confirmed that big data has issues to be addressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data privacy must be preserved in order to protect not only
    individuals but also data users who would face risks of data
    breaches and subsequent fines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biases in a set of big data can affect inference significantly
    through proxies, even when factors about gender and race are
    omitted, and focus on correlation rather than causation makes
    predictive models vulnerable to model drift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let us discuss the difference between a traditional big data ML
    system and an FL system in terms of their architectures, processes,
    issues, and benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following diagram depicts a visual comparison between a
    traditional big data ML system and an FL system:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 1.3 -- Comparison between traditional big data ML system and FL
system " src="../images/media/image72.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="3.716666666666667in"}</p>
<p>Figure 1.3 -- Comparison between traditional big data ML system and FL
system</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the traditional big data system, data is gathered to create large
    data stores. These large data stores are used to solve a specific
    problem using ML. The resulting model displays strong
    generalizability due to the volume of data it is trained on and is
    eventually deployed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, continuous data collection uses large amounts of
    communication bandwidth. In privacy-focused applications, the
    transmission of data may be banned entirely, making model creation
    impossible. Training large ML models on big data stores is
    computationally expensive, and traditional centralized training
    efficiency is limited by single-machine performance. Slow training
    processes lead to long delays between incremental model updates,
    leading to a lack of flexibility in accommodating new data trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, in an FL system, ML training is performed
    directly at the location of the data. The resulting trained models
    are collected at the central server. Aggregation algorithms are used
    to produce an aggregated model from the collected models. The
    aggregated model is sent back to the data locations for further
    training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL approaches often incur overhead to set up and maintain training
    performance with distributed-system settings. However, even with a
    bit more complicated architecture and settings, there are benefits
    that exceed its complexity drawbacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training is performed at the data location, so data is never
    transmitted, maintaining data privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training can be performed asynchronously across a variable number of
    nodes, which results in efficient and easily scalable distributed
    learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only model weights are transmitted between server and nodes, thus FL
    is efficient in communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced aggregation algorithms can maintain training performance
    even in restricted scenarios and increase efficiency in standard ML
    scenarios too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vast majority of all AI projects do not seem to be delivered, or
    simply fall short altogether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To deliver an authentic AI application and product, all the issues
    discussed previously need to be considered seriously. It is obvious
    that FL, together with other key technologies to deal with local
    data processed by the ML pipeline and engine, is getting to be a
    critical solution to resolve data-related problems in a continuous
    and collaborative manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we harness the power of AI and ML to optimize the technical
    system for society in its entirety---that is, bring about a more
    joyous, comfortable, convenient, and safe world while being data
    minimalistic and ethical, as well as delivering improvements
    continuously?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We contend that the key is a <em>collective
    intelligence</em> or <em>intelligence-centric</em> platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In subsequent sections, we introduce the concept, design, and
    implementation of an FL system as a promising technology for
    orchestrating collective intelligence with networks of AI and ML
    models to fulfill those requirements discussed so far.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This section provided an overview of how FL could potentially solve
    many of the big data issues by first understanding the definition of
    big data and its nature, involving an abundance of observations,
    acceptance of messiness, and ambivalence of causality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have learned about privacy regulations in a variety of forms from
    many regions and the risk of data breaches and privacy violations
    that eventually lead to loss of profits, as well as a bottleneck in
    creating authentic AI applications. Federated learning, by design,
    will not collect any raw data and can preserve data privacy and
    follow those regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, with an FL framework, we can reduce inherent bias that
    affects the performance of ML models and minimize model drift with a
    continuous learning framework. Thus, a distributed and collaborative
    learning framework such as FL is required for a more cost-effective
    and efficient approach based on FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This introductory section concluded with the potential of FL as a
    primary solution for the aforementioned big data problems based on
    the paradigm-shifting idea of collective intelligence that could
    potentially replace the current mainstream data-centric platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next section, we will see where in the landscape of data
    science FL fits and how it can open a new era of ML.</p>

<p>What Is Federated Learning?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This section frames <strong>federated learning</strong> (<strong>FL</strong>) as the answer to
    the desire for this new ML approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a nutshell, FL is an approach to ML that allows models to be
    trained in parallel across data sources without the transmission of
    any data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal of This section is to build up the case for the FL
    approach, with explanations of the necessary conceptual building
    blocks in order to ensure that you can achieve a similar
    understanding of the technical aspects and practical usage of FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After going through this section, you should have a high-level
    understanding of the FL process and should be able to visualize
    where the approach slots into real-world problem domains.</p>

</ul>
<p>ML - Current State</p>
<ul>
<li>To understand why the benefits derived from the application of FL
    can outweigh the increased complexity of this approach, it is
    necessary to understand how ML is currently practiced and the
    associated limitations. The goal of this section is to provide you
    with this context.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Model</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The term "model" finds usage across numerous different disciplines;
    however, the generalized definition we are interested in can be
    narrowed down to a working representation of the dynamics within
    some desired system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simply put, we develop a model B of some phenomenon A as a means of
    better understanding A through the increased interaction offered by
    B.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the phenomenon of an object being dropped from some point
    in a vacuum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using kinematic equations, we can compute exactly how long it will
    take for the object to hit the ground -- this is a model of the
    aforementioned phenomenon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The power of this approach is the ability to observe results from
    the created model without having to explicitly interact with the
    phenomenon in question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, the model of the falling object allows us to determine
    the difference in fall time between a 10 kg object and a 50 kg
    object at some height without having to physically drop real objects
    from said height in a real vacuum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evidently, the modeling of natural phenomena plays a key role in
    being able to claim a true understanding of said phenomena.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing the need for the comprehensive observation of a phenomenon
    allows for true generalization in the decision-making process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The concept of a model is greatly narrowed down within the context
    of computer science. In this context, models are algorithms that
    allow for some key values of a phenomenon to be output given some
    initial characterization of the phenomenon in question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Going back to the falling object example, a computer science model
    could entail the computation of values such as the time to hit the
    ground and the maximum speed given the mass of the object and the
    height from which it is dropped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These computer science models are uniquely powerful due to the
    superhuman ability of computers to compute the output from countless
    starting phenomenon configurations, offering us even greater
    understanding and generalization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, how do we create such models?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first and simplest approach is building rule-based systems
    or <strong>white-box</strong> models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A white-box (also known as glass-box or clear-box) model is made by
    writing down the underlying functions of a system of interest
    explicitly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is only possible when information about the system is
    available <em>a priori</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Naturally, in this case, the underlying functions are relatively
    simple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One such example is the problem of classifying a randomly selected
    integer as odd or even; we can easily write an algorithm to do this
    by <em>checking the remainder after dividing the integer by two</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to see how much it costs to fill up your gas tank, given
    how empty the tank is and the price per gallon, you can just
    multiply those values together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite their simplicity, these examples illustrate that simple
    models can have a lot of practical applications in various fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unfortunately, the white-box modeling of underlying functions can
    quickly become too complex to perform directly. In general, systems
    are often too complex for us to be able to construct a white-box
    model for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, let's say you want to predict the future values of your
    property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have a lot of metrics about the property, such as the area, how
    old it is, its location, and interest rate to name but a few.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You believe that there is likely a linear relationship between the
    property value and all of those metrics, such that the weighted sum
    of all of them would give you the property value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, if you actually try to build a white-box model under that
    assumption, you will have to directly figure out what the parameter
    (weight) for each metric is, which implies that you must know the
    underlying function of the real estate pricing system. Usually, this
    is not the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, we need another approach: <strong>black box</strong> modeling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Automating Model Creation</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The concept of a black box system was first developed in the field
    of electric circuits during the WWII period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was the famous cybernetician Norbert Wiener who began treating
    the black box as an abstract concept, and a general theory was
    established by Mario Augusto Bunge in the 1960s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The function for estimating future property values, as illustrated
    earlier, is a good example of a black box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you might expect, the function is complex enough that it is
    unreasonable for us to try to write a white-box model to represent
    it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is where ML comes in, allowing us to create a model as a black
    box.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Reference</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You might be aware that black box modeling has been criticized for
    its lack of interpretability, an important concept outside the scope
    of this tutorial; <em>Interpretable Machine Learning</em> covers this area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ML is a type of artificial intelligence that is used to
    automatically generate model parameters for making decisions and
    predictions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Figure 2.1</em> illustrates this in a very simple way: those cases
    where the known values and the unknown value have a linear
    relationship allow a popular algorithm, called <strong>ordinary least
    squares</strong> (<strong>OLS</strong>), to be applied. OLS computes the unknown
    parameters of the linear relationship by finding the set of
    parameters that produces the closest predictions on some set of
    known examples (pairs of input feature value sets and the true
    output value):</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.1 -- ML determining model parameters

<p>Figure 2.1 -- ML determining model parameters</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The preceding diagram displays a simple two-dimensional linear
    regression problem with one feature/input variable and one output
    variable. In this toy two-dimensional case, it might be relatively
    straightforward for us to come up with the parameters representing
    the best-fit relationship directly, either through implicit
    knowledge or through testing different values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, it should be clear that this approach quickly becomes
    intractable as the number of feature variables increases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OLS allows us to attack this problem from the reverse direction:
    instead of producing linear relationships and evaluating them on the
    data, we can use the data to compute the parameters of the best-fit
    relationship directly instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revisiting the real estate problem, let's assume that we have
    collected a large number of property valuation data points,
    consisting of the associated metric values and the sale price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can apply OLS to take these points and find the relationship
    between each metric and the sale price for any property (still under
    the assumption that the true relationship is linear).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From this, we can pass in the metric values of our property and get
    the predicted sale price.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The power of this approach is the abstraction of this relationship
    computation from any implicit knowledge of the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The OLS algorithm doesn't care what the data represents -- it just
    finds the best line for the data it is given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This class of approaches is exactly what ML entails, granting the
    power to create models of phenomena without any required knowledge
    of the internal relationship, given a sufficient amount of data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a nutshell, ML lets us program algorithms that can learn to
    create models from data, and our motivation to do so is to
    approximate complex systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that the underlying functions of a
    complex system can change over time due to outside factors, quickly
    making models created from old data obsolete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, the preceding linear regression model might not work to
    estimate property values in a far distant future or a faraway
    district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variance in such a macroscopic scale is not taken into account in a
    model containing only a few dozen parameters, and we would need
    different models for separate groups of adjacent data points --
    unless we employ even more sophisticated ML approaches such
    as <strong>deep learning</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Deep Learning (DL)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So, how did deep learning become synonymous with ML in common usage?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deep learning involves the application of a <strong>deep neural
    network</strong> (<strong>DNN</strong>), which is a type of highly-parameterized model
    inspired by the transmission of signals between neurons in the
    brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The foundation of deep learning was established in the early 1960s
    by Frank Rosenblatt, who is known as the <em>father of deep learning</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His work was further developed in the 1970s and 1980s by computer
    scientists including Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio,
    and the term <em>deep learning</em> was popularized by the University of
    California, Irvine's distinguished Professor Rina Dechter. Deep
    learning can conduct much more complex tasks compared to simpler ML
    algorithms such as linear regression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the specifics are beyond the scope of this book, the key
    problem that deep learning was able to solve was the <strong><em>modeling of
    complex non-linear relationships</em></strong>, pushing ML as a whole to the
    forefront of numerous fields due to the increased modeling ability
    it provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This ability has been mathematically proven via specific universal
    approximation theorems for different model size cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over the past decade, ever-increasingly powerful models have been
    built by tech giants against the backdrop of big data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we look at the state-of-the-art deep learning models today, they
    could have up to trillions of parameters; expectedly, this gives
    them unparalleled flexibility in modeling complex functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reason deep learning models can be scaled up to arbitrarily
    increase performance, unlike other ML model types used previously,
    is due to a phenomenon called <strong>double descent</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This refers to the ability for a certain parameterization/training
    threshold to overcome the standard bias-variance trade-off (where
    increasing complexity leads to fine-tuning on training data,
    reducing bias but increasing variance) and continuing to increase
    performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key takeaway is that the performance of deep learning models can
    be considered to be limited by just the available compute power and
    data, two factors that have surged in growth in the past 10 years
    due to advances in computing and the ever-increasing number of
    devices and software collecting data, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deep learning has become intertwined with ML, with deep learning
    playing a significant role within the current state of ML and big
    data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section focused on establishing a case for the importance of
    the modeling performed by current ML techniques. In a sense, this
    can be considered the <em>what</em> -- what exactly FL is trying to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, we will focus on the <em>where</em> in terms of the desired setting
    for numerous ML applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Distributed Learning and Scalability</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this section, we introduce the distributed computing setting and
    discuss the intersection of this setting with ML approaches to fully
    establish the support for why FL is necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal of the section is for the user to understand both the
    benefits and limitations imposed by the distributed computing
    setting, in order to understand how FL addresses some of these
    limitations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Distributed computing</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The past several years have shown a large but predictable rise in
    the development of new approaches and the conversion of existing
    server infrastructure within the lens of distributed computing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To generalize further, distributed approaches themselves have
    shifted more and more from research implementations to extensive use
    in production settings; one significant example of this phenomenon
    is the usage of cloud computing platforms such as <strong>AWS</strong>
    from Amazon, <strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong> (<strong>GCP</strong>) from Google, and
    <strong>Azure</strong> from Microsoft. It turns out that the flexibility of
    on-demand resources allows for cost-saving and efficiency in
    numerous applications that would, otherwise, be bottlenecked by
    on-premise servers and computational power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While a parallel cannot exactly be drawn between cloud computing and
    the concept of distributed computing, the key benefits stemming from
    the distributed nature are similar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a high level, distributed computing involves spreading the work
    necessary for some computational task over a number of computational
    agents in a way that allows each to act near-autonomously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following figure shows the difference between centralized and
    distributed approaches in the high-level context of answering
    questions:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 2.2 -- Centralized versus distributed question answering</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this simple example, the centralized approach involves processing
    the input questions sequentially, whereas the distributed approach
    is able to process each question at the same time. It should be
    clear that the parallel approach trades off computational resource
    usage for increased answering speed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The question, then, is whether this trade-off is beneficial for
    real-world applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Real-world example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To understand the practical benefits of distributed computing
    approaches, let's analyze an example business problem through a
    traditional and a distributed computing lens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider an e-commerce business that is trying to host its website
    using on-premise servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The traditional way to do this would be to perform enough analysis
    on the business side to determine the expected volume of traffic at
    some future time and invest in one or a couple of server machines
    large enough to handle that calculated volume.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several cases immediately lend themselves to showing the flaws of
    such an approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider a scenario where usage of the websites greatly exceeds the
    initial projections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A fixed number of servers means that all upgrades must be hardware
    upgrades, resulting in old hardware that had to be purchased and is
    no longer used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Going further, there are no guarantees that the now-increased usage
    will stay fixed. Further increases in usage will result in more
    scaling-up costs, while decreases in usage will lead to wasted
    resources (maintaining large servers when smaller machines would be
    sufficient).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A key point is that the integration of additional servers is
    non-trivial due to the single-machine approach used to manage
    hosting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, we have to consider the hardware limitations of
    handling large numbers of requests in parallel with one or a few
    machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to handle requests in parallel is limited for each
    machine -- significant volumes of traffic would be almost guaranteed
    to eventually be bottlenecked regardless of the power available to
    each server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In comparison, consider the distributed computing-based solution for
    this problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the initial business projections, a number of smaller
    server machines are purchased and each is set up to handle some
    fixed volume of traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the scenario of incoming traffic exceeding projects arises, no
    modification to the existing machines is necessary; instead, more
    similarly-sized servers can be purchased and configured to handle
    their designated volume of new traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the incoming traffic decreases, the equivalent number of servers
    can be shut down or shifted to handle other tasks. This means that
    the same hardware can be used for variable volumes of traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This ability to scale quickly to handle the necessary computational
    task at any moment is precisely due to how distributed computing
    approaches allow for computational agents to seamlessly start and
    stop working on said task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, the use of many smaller machines in parallel, versus
    using fewer larger machines, means that the number of requests that
    can be handled at the same time is notably higher. It is clear that
    a distributed computing approach, in this case, lends itself to
    cost-saving and flexibility that cannot be matched with more
    traditional methods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Distributed Computing - The benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In general, distributed computing approaches offer three main
    benefits for any computational task -- scalability, throughput, and
    resilience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the previous case of web hosting, scalability referred to the
    ability to scale the number of servers deployed based on the amount
    of incoming traffic, whereas throughput refers to the ability to
    reduce request processing latency through the inherent parallelism
    of smaller servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this example, resilience could refer to the ability of other
    deployed servers to take on the load from a server that stops
    working, allowing the hosting to continue relatively unfazed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distributed computing often finds uses when working with large
    stores of data, especially when attempting to perform analyses on
    the data using a single machine would be computationally infeasible
    or otherwise undesirable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In these cases, scalability allows for the deployment of a variable
    number of agents based on factors such as the desired runtime and
    amount of data at any given time, whereas the ability of each agent
    to autonomously work on processing a subset of the data in parallel
    allows for processing throughput that would be impossible for a
    single high-power machine to achieve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It turns out that this lack of reliance on cutting-edge hardware
    leads to further cost savings, as hardware price-to-performance
    ratios are often not linear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the development of parallelized software to operate in a
    distributed computing setting is non-trivial, hopefully, it is clear
    that many practical computational tasks greatly benefit from the
    scalability and throughput achieved by such approaches.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Distributed ML</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When thinking about the types of computational tasks that have
    proven to be valuable in practical applications and that might be
    directly benefited from increased scalability and throughput, it is
    clear that the rapidly growing field of ML is near the top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, we can frame ML tasks as a specific example of the
    aforementioned tasks of analyzing large stores of data, placing
    emphasis on the data being processed and the nature of the analysis
    being performed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The joint growth of cheap computational power (for example, smart
    devices) and the proven benefits of data analysis and modeling have
    led to companies with both the storage of excessive amounts of data
    and the desire to extract meaningful insights and predictions from
    said data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second part is exactly what ML is geared to solve, and large
    amounts of work have already been completed to do so in various
    domains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, like other computational tasks, performing ML on large
    stores of data often leads to a time-computational power trade-off
    in which more powerful machines are needed to perform such tasks in
    reasonable amounts of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As ML algorithms become more computationally and memory-intensive,
    such as recent state-of-the-art deep learning models with billions
    of parameters, hardware bottlenecks make increasing the
    computational power infeasible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, current ML tasks must apply distributed computing
    approaches to stay cutting-edge while producing results in usable
    timeframes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ML at the Edge</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Although the prevalence of deep learning described earlier, besides
    the paradigm shift from big data to collective intelligence gives
    enough motivation for distributed ML, its physical foundation came
    from the recent development of <strong>edge computing</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>edge</em> represents the close proximity around deployed solutions;
    it follows that edge computing refers to processing data at or near
    the location of the data source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extending the concept of computation to ML leads to the idea
    of <strong>edge AI</strong>, where models are integrated directly into edge
    devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few popular examples would be Amazon Alexa, where edge AI takes
    care of speech recognition, and self-driving cars that collect
    real-world data and incrementally improve with edge AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most ubiquitous example is the smartphone -- some potential uses
    are the recommendation of content to the user, searches with voice
    assistance and auto-complete, auto-sorting of pictures into an album
    and gallery search, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To capitalize on this potential, smartphone manufacturers have
    already begun integrating ML-focused processor components into the
    chips they integrate with their newest phones, such as the <em>Neural
    Processing Unit</em> from <em>Samsung</em> and the <em>Tensor Processing Unit</em> on
    the <em>Google Tensor chip</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google has also worked to develop ML-focused APIs for Android
    applications through their <em>Android ML Kit SDK</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From this, it should be clear that ML applications are shifting
    toward the edge computing paradigm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's say that smartphones need to use a deep learning model for
    word recommendation. This is so that when you type words on your
    phone, it gives you suggestions for the next word, with the goal
    being to save you some time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the scheme of a centralized computing process, the central server
    is the only component that has access to this text prediction model
    and none of the phones have the model stored locally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The central server handles all of the requests sent from the phones
    to return word recommendations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you type, your phone has to send what has been typed along with
    some personal information about you, all the way to the central
    server. The server receives this information, makes a prediction
    using the deep learning model, and then sends the result back to the
    phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following figure reflects this scenario:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.3 -- Centralized inference scenario
" src="../images/media/image78.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="2.5076388888888888in"}</p>
<p>Figure 2.3 -- Centralized inference scenario</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are a few problems that become apparent when you look at this
    scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, even a half to one second of latency makes the recommendation
    slower than typing everything yourself, making the system useless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, if there is no internet connection, the recommendation
    simply does not work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another restriction of this scheme is the need for the central
    server to process all of these requests. Imagine how many
    smartphones are being used in the world, and you will realize a lack
    of feasibility due to the extreme scale of this solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, let's look at the same problem from the edge computing
    perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if the smartphones themselves contain the deep learning model?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The central server is only in charge of managing the latest trained
    model and communicating this model with each phone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, whenever you start typing, your phone can use the received
    model locally to make recommendations from what you typed. The
    following figure reflects this scenario:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.4 -- Edge inference scenario
" src="../images/media/image70.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="2.704861111111111in"}</p>
<p>Figure 2.4 -- Edge inference scenario</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This removes both the latency problem and prevents the need to
    handle the incoming inference requests at a central location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, the phones no longer have to maintain a connection with
    the server to make a recommendation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each phone is in charge of fulfilling requests from its user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the core benefit of edge computing: <em>we have moved the
    computing load from the central server to the edge devices/servers</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Training at the Edge</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The distinction between centralized and decentralized computing can
    be extended to the concept of model training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's stick to the smartphone example but think about how we would
    train the predictive model instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, in the centralized ML process, all of the data used to train
    the recommendation model must be collected from the users' devices
    and stored on the central server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, the collected data is used to train a model, which is
    eventually sent to all the phones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that the central server still has to be able to handle
    the large volume of user data coming in and store it in an efficient
    way to be able to train the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This design leads to the problems found in the centralized computing
    approach: as the number of phones connected to the server increases,
    the server's ability to work with the incoming data needs to scale
    in order to maintain the training process. In addition, since the
    data needs to be transmitted and stored centrally in this approach,
    there is always the possibility of the interception of transmissions
    or even attacks on the stored data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are several cases where data confidentiality and privacy are
    required or strongly desired; for example, applications in the
    financial and medical industries. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Centralized model training thus limits use cases, and an
    alternative way to work with data directly on edge devices is
    required</em>. This exact setting is the motivation for FL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FL - The technical bits</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This section focuses on providing a high-level technical
    understanding of how FL actually slots in as a solution to the
    problem setting described in the previous section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal of this section is for you to understand how FL fits as a
    solution, and to provide a conceptual basis that will be filled in
    by the subsequent sections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FL Definition</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Federated learning is a method to synthesize global models from
    local models trained on the edge</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL was first developed by Google in 2016 for their Gboard
    application, which incorporates the context of an Android user's
    typing history to suggest corrections and propose candidates for
    subsequent words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indeed, this is the exact word recommendation problem discussed in
    the <em>Edge inference</em> and <em>Edge training</em> sections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The solution that Google produced was a decentralized training
    approach where an iterative process would compute model training
    updates at the edge, aggregating these updates to produce the global
    update to be applied to the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This core concept of aggregating model updates was key in allowing
    for a single, performant model to be produced from edge training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's break this concept down further.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The desired model is distributed across the edge and is trained on
    data collected locally at the edge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, we can expect that a model trained on one specific data
    source is not going to be representative of the entire dataset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, we dub such models trained with limited data <strong>local
    models</strong>. One immediate benefit of this approach is the enabling of
    ML on data that would otherwise not be collected in the centralized
    case, due to issues with privacy and efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aggregation, the key theoretical step of FL, allows for our desired
    single <strong>global model</strong> to be created from the set of local models
    produced at some iteration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most well-known aggregation algorithm, popular for its
    simplicity and surprising performance, is called <strong>federated
    averaging</strong> (<strong>FedAvg</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FedAvg is performed on a set of local models by computing the
    <strong><em>parameter-wise arithmetic mean</em></strong> across the models, producing an
    aggregate model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to understand that performing aggregation <strong>once</strong>
    is <strong>not enough</strong> to produce a good global aggregate model; instead,
    it is the <strong>iterative process of locally training</strong> <strong>the previous
    global model</strong> and <strong>aggregating the produced local models into a
    new global model</strong> that allows for global training progress to be
    made.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The FL process</p>
<p>To better understand FL from an iterative process perspective, we break
it down into the core constituent steps of a single iteration,
or <em>round</em>.</p>
<p>The steps for a round can be described as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The aggregate global model parameters are sent to each user's
    device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The received ML models located on the user devices are trained with
    local data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a certain amount of training, the local model parameters are
    sent to the central server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The central server aggregates the local models by applying an
    aggregation function, producing a new aggregate global model.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps are depicted in <em>Figure 2.5</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.5 -- FL steps
" src="../images/media/image77.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="4.667361111111111in"}</p>
<p>Figure 2.5 -- FL steps</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The flow from <em>steps 1 to 4</em> constitutes a single round of FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next round begins as the user servers/devices receive the newly
    created aggregate model and start training on the local data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's revisit Google's word recommendation for Gboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At some point in time, each phone stores a sufficient amount of its
    user's typing data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The edge training process can create a local model from it, and the
    parameters will be sent to the central server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After receiving parameters from <strong><em>a certain number of phones</em></strong>,
    the server aggregates them to create a global model and sends it to
    the phones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This way, every phone connected to the server receives a model that
    reflects local data in all of the phones without ever transmitting
    the data from them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In turn, each phone retrains the model when another batch of
    sufficient data is collected, sends the model to the server, and
    receives a new global model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This cycle repeats itself over and over according to the
    configuration of the FL system, resulting in the continuous
    monitoring and updating of the global model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that the <strong><em>user data never leaves the edge</em></strong>, only the model
    parameters; nor is there a need to put all the data in a central
    server to generate a global model, allowing for data minimalism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moreover, model bias can be mitigated with FL methods, as discussed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is why FL can be regarded as a solution to the three issues of
    big data, which were introduced earlier (Triple A).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transfer learning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FL is closely related to an ML concept called <strong>transfer
    learning</strong> (<strong>TL</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TL allows us to use large deep learning models that have been
    trained by researchers using plentiful compute power and resources
    on very generalized datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These models can be applied to more specific problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, we can take an object detection model trained to locate
    and name specific objects in images and retrain it on a limited
    dataset containing specific objects we are interested in, which were
    not included in the original data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you were to take the original data, add to it the data of those
    objects of our interest, and then train a model from scratch, a lot
    of computational time and power would be required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With TL, you can quicken the process by leveraging a key fact about
    those existing large, generalized models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a tendency for the intermediate layers of large DNNs to be
    excellent at extracting features, used by the following layers for
    the specific ML task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can maintain its learned ability to extract features by
    preserving the parameters in those layers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In other words, parameters in certain layers of existing pre-trained
    models can be <strong>preserved</strong> and used to detect new objects -- we do
    not need to reinvent the wheel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This technique is called <strong>parameter freezing</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In FL, model training often takes place in local devices/servers
    with limited computational power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One example using the Gboard scenario is performing parameter
    freezing on a pre trained word embedding layer to allow training to
    focus on task-specific information, leveraging prior training of the
    embeddings to greatly reduce the trainable parameter count.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking this concept further, the intersection of FL and TL is
    called <strong>federated transfer learning</strong> (<strong>FTL</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTL allows for the FL approach to be applied in cases where the
    local datasets differ in structure by performing FL on a shared
    subset of the model that can later be extended for specific tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, a sentiment analysis model and a text summarization
    model could both share a sentence encoding component, which can be
    trained using FL and used for both tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TL (and, by extension, FTL) are key concepts that allow for training
    efficiency and incremental improvement to be realized in FL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Personalization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When edge devices are dealing with data that is not <strong>independent
    and identically distributed</strong> (<strong>IID</strong>), each device can customize
    the global model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is an idea called <strong>personalization</strong>, which can be considered
    as fine-tuning the global model with local data, or the strategic
    use of bias in the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, consider a shopping mall chain that operates in two
    areas with distinct local demographics (that is, the chain deals
    with non-IID data).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the chain seeks tenant recommendations for both locations using
    FL, each of the locations can be better served with personalized
    models than a single global model, helping attract local customers.
    Since the personalized model is fine-tuned or <em>biased</em> with local
    data, we can expect that its performance on general data would not
    be as good as that of the global model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, we can also expect that the personalized model
    performs better than the global model on the local data for which
    the model is personalized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a trade-off between user-specific performance and
    generalizability, and the power of an FL system comes from its
    flexibility to balance them according to the requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Horizontal and Vertical FL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are two types of FL: <strong>horizontal</strong> or <strong>homogeneous
    FL</strong> and <strong>vertical</strong> or <strong>heterogeneous FL</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Horizontal FL, also called <strong>sample-based FL</strong>, is applicable when
    all local datasets connected with the aggregator server have the
    same features but contain different samples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Gboard application discussed earlier is a good example of
    horizontal FL in the form of <strong>cross-device FL</strong>, that is, local
    training taking place in edge devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The datasets in all Android phones have identical formats but unique
    contents that reflect their user's typing history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, vertical FL, or <strong>feature-based FL</strong>, is a more
    advanced technology that allows parties holding different features
    for the same samples to cooperatively generate a global model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, a bank and an e-commerce company might both store the
    data of residents in a city but their features would differ: the
    former knows the credit and expenditure patterns of the citizens,
    the latter their shopping behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both of them can benefit by sharing valuable insights without
    sharing customer data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, the bank and e-commerce company can identify their common
    users with a technique called <strong>private set intersection</strong> (<strong>PSI</strong>)
    while preserving data privacy
    using <strong>Rivest-Shamir-Adleman</strong> (<strong>RSA</strong>) encryption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, each party trains a preliminary model with local data
    containing unique features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those models are then aggregated to construct a global model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually, vertical FL involves multiple data silos, and when that is
    the case, it is also called <strong>cross-silo FL</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In China, <strong>federated Ai ecosystem</strong> (<strong>FATE</strong>) is well known for
    its seminal demonstration of vertical FL involving WeBank. If you
    are interested in further conceptual details of FL, there is a very
    illustrative and well-written report by Cloudera Fast Forward Labs,
    at https://federated.fastforwardlabs.com/.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The information on FL contained in this section should be sufficient
    to understand the following parts, which examine, in further depth,
    some of the key concepts introduced here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final section aims to cover some of the auxiliary concepts
    focused on the practical application of FL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>System Considerations for FL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This section mainly focuses on the multi-party computation aspects
    of FL, including theoretical security measures and full
    decentralization approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal of this section is for you to be aware of some of the more
    practical considerations that should be taken into account for
    practical FL applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Security Considerations for FL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Despite the nascency of the technology, experimental usage of FL has
    emerged in a few sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifically, <strong>anti-money laundering</strong> (<strong>AML</strong>) in the financial
    industry and drug discovery and diagnosis in the medical industry
    have seen promising results, as proofs of concepts in those fields
    have been successfully conducted by companies such as Consilient and
    Owkin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In AML use cases, banks can cooperate with one another to identify
    fraudulent transactions efficiently without sharing their account
    data; and hospitals can keep their patient data to themselves while
    improving ML models for detecting health issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These solutions exploit the power of relatively simple horizontal
    cross-silo FL, as explained in the <em>Understanding FL</em> section, and
    its application is spreading to other areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, Edgify is a UK-based company contributing to the
    automation of cashiers at retail stores in collaboration with Intel
    and Hewlett Packard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Munich, Germany, another UK-based company, Fetch.ai, is
    developing a smart city infrastructure with their FL-based
    technology. It is clear that the practical application of FL is
    rapidly growing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although FL can circumvent the concern over data privacy thanks to
    its privacy-by-design (model parameters do not expose privacy) and
    data minimalist (data is not collected in the central server)
    approach, there are potential obstructions against its
    implementation; one such example is <em>mistrust</em> among the
    participants of an FL project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider a situation where <em>Bank A</em> and <em>Bank B</em> agree to use FL for
    developing a collaborative AML solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They decide on the common model architecture so that each can train
    a local model with their own data and aggregate the results to
    create a global model to be used by both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Naïve implementations of FL might allow for one bank to reconstruct
    the local model from the other bank, using their local model and the
    aggregate model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From this, the bank might be able to extract key information on the
    data used to train the other bank's model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, there might be a dispute regarding which party should
    host the server to aggregate the local models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A possible solution is having a third party host the server and take
    responsibility for model aggregation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet, how would <em>Bank A</em> know that the third party is not colluding
    with <em>Bank B</em>, and vice versa?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Going further, the integration of an FL system into a
    security-focused domain leads to new concerns regarding the security
    and stability of each system component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Known security issues tied to different FL system approaches might
    incur an additional potential weakness to adversarial attacks that
    outweighs the benefits of the approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are several security measures to allow FL collaboration
    without forcing the participants to trust one another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a statistical method called <strong>differential privacy</strong> (<strong>DP</strong>),
    each participant can add random noise to their local model
    parameters to prevent the ability to glean information on the
    training data distribution or specific elements from the transmitted
    parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By sampling the random noise from a symmetric distribution with zero
    mean and relatively low variance (for example, Gaussian, Laplace),
    the random differences added to the local models are expected to
    cancel out when aggregation is performed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, the global model is expected to be very similar to what
    would have been generated without DP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, there is a critical limitation to this approach; for the
    sum of the added random noise to converge to zero, a sufficient
    number of parties must participate in the coalition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This might not be the case for projects involving only a few banks
    or hospitals, and using DP in such cases would harm the global
    model's integrity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some additional measures would be necessary, for example, each
    participant sending multiple copies of their local model to increase
    the number of models so that the noise will be offset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another possibility in certain fully-decentralized FL systems
    is <strong>secure multi-party computation</strong> (<strong>MPC</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MPC-based aggregation allows agents to communicate among themselves
    and compute the aggregate model without involving a trusted
    third-party server, maintaining model parameter privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How could the participants secure the system from outside attacks? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Homomorphic encryption</strong> (<strong>HE</strong>), which preserves the effects of
    addition and multiplication on data across encryption, allows the
    local models to be aggregated into the global model in an encrypted
    form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This precludes the exposure of model parameters to outsiders who do
    not possess the key for decryption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet, HE's effectiveness in securing the communication between
    the participants comes with a prohibitively high computational cost:
    processing the operation on data with the HE algorithm can take
    hundreds of trillions of times longer than otherwise!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A solution to mitigate this challenge is the use of partial HE,
    which is compatible with only one of the additive or multiplicative
    operations across encryption; therefore it is computationally much
    lighter than the fully homomorphic counterpart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using this scheme, each participant in a coalition can encrypt and
    send their local model to the aggregator, which then sums up all
    local models and sends the aggregated model back to the
    participants, who, in turn, decrypt the model and divide its
    parameters by the number of participants to receive the global
    model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both HE and DP are essential technology for the practical
    application of FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those interested in the implementation of FL in real-world scenarios
    can learn a great deal from <em>Federated AI for Real-World Business
    Scenarios</em> written by IBM Research Fellow Dinesh C. Verma.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Decentralized FL and Blockchain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The architecture of FL discussed so far is based on client-server
    networks, that is, edge devices exchanging models with a central
    aggregator server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to the issues surrounding trust between the participants of FL
    coalitions discussed earlier; however, building a system with an
    aggregator as a separate and central entity can be problematic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can be difficult for the host of an aggregator to be impartial
    and unbiased toward their own data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, having a central server inevitably leads to a single point of
    failure in the FL system, which results in low resilience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, if the aggregator is set up in a cloud server, the
    implementation of such an FL system would require a skilled DevOps
    engineer, who might be difficult to find and expensive to hire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given these concerns, Kiyoshi Nakayama co-authored an article about
    the first-ever experimentation of a fully decentralized FL system
    using blockchain technology
    (<a href="http://www.kiyoshi-nakayama.com/publications/BAFFLE.pdf">[http://www.kiyoshi-nakayama.com/publications/BAFFLE.pdf]{.underline}</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leveraging <strong>smart contracts</strong> to coordinate model updates and
    aggregation, a private Ethereum network was constructed to perform
    FL in a serverless manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The results of the experiment showed that a <strong><em>peer-to-peer,
    decentralized FL can be much more efficient and scalable than an
    aggregator-based, centralized FL</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The superiority of decentralized architecture was confirmed in a
    more recent experiment conducted by Hewlett Packard and German
    research institutes who gave a unique name to decentralized FL with
    blockchain technology: <strong>swarm learning</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While research and development in the field of FL are shifting to a
    decentralized model, the rest of this book assumes centralized
    architecture with an aggregator server. There are two reasons for
    this design. First, blockchain is still a nascent technology that AI
    and ML researchers are not necessarily familiar with. Incorporating
    a peer-to-peer communication scheme can overcomplicate the subject
    matter. And second, the logic of FL itself is independent of the
    network architecture, and there is no problem with the centralized
    model to illustrate how FL works.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here, we covered the two key developments that have resulted from
    the recent growth in accessible computational power at all levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, we looked at the importance of models and how this has
    enabled ML to grow considerably in practical usage, with increases
    in computational power allowing stronger models that surpass
    manually created white-box systems to continuously be produced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We called this the <em>what</em> of FL -- ML is what we are trying to
    perform using FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, we took a step back to look at how edge devices are reaching a
    stage where complex computations can be performed within reasonable
    timeframes for real-world applications, such as the text
    recommendation models on our phones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We called this the <em>where</em> of FL -- the setting where we want to
    perform ML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the what and the where, we get the intersection of these two
    developments -- the usage of ML models directly on edge devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember that the standard central training approach for ML models
    greatly suffers from the need to centrally collect all of the data
    in the edge ML case, as this prevents applications requiring
    efficient communication or data privacy from being possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We showed that <em>FL</em> directly addresses this problem by performing
    all training at the edge to produce <em>local models</em>, at the same
    location as the requisite data stores. <em>Aggregation</em> algorithms take
    these local models and produce a <em>global model</em>. By iteratively
    switching between local training and aggregation,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL allows for the creation of a model that has effectively been
    trained across all data stores without ever needing to centrally
    collect the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We concluded the part by stepping outside the theory behind
    effective aggregation, looking at system and architecture design
    considerations regarding aspects such as model privacy and full
    decentralization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After reading, it should be clear that the current state of ML, edge
    computing, and fledgling growth in practical FL applications makes
    it clear that FL is poised for serious growth in the near future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next part, we will examine the implementation of FL from a
    system-level perspective.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[Section 3: FL - The System Details_______]{.underline}</strong></p>
<p>Federated Learning Systems</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This section will provide an overview of the architecture, procedure
    flow, sequence of messages, and basics of model aggregation of
    the <strong>federated learning</strong> (<strong>FL</strong>) system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As discussed earlier, the basics of the FL framework is quite easy
    to understand. However, the real implementation of the FL framework
    needs to come with a good understanding of both AI and distributed
    systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The content of this section is based on the most standard foundation
    of FL systems, which is used in hands-on exercises later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, we will introduce the building blocks of FL systems, such as
    an aggregator with an FL server, an agent with an FL client, a
    database server, and communication between these components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The architecture introduced here is designed in a decoupled way so
    that further enhancement to the system will be relatively easier
    than with an FL system that contains everything on one machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, an explanation of the flow of the operation of FL from
    initialization to aggregation will follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we will examine the way an FL system is scaled with a
    horizontal design of decentralized FL setups.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This section covers the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FL system architecture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding the FL system flow -- from initialization to
    continuous operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basics of model aggregation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthering scalability with horizontal design</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The System Architecture</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FL systems are distributed systems that are comprised of servers and
    distributed clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, we will define a representative architecture of an FL system
    with the following components: an aggregator with an FL server, an
    agent with an FL client, and a database:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-2-1" name="__codelineno-2-1" href="#__codelineno-2-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   <strong>Cluster aggregator</strong> (or <strong>aggregator</strong>): A system with an FL
    server that collects and aggregates <strong>machine learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>)
    models that are trained at multiple distributed agents (defined
    shortly) and creates global ML models that are sent back to the
    agents. This system serves as a <em>cluster aggregator</em>, or more
    simply, an <em>aggregator</em> of FL systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Distributed agent</strong> (or <strong>agent</strong>): A distributed
    learning environment with an FL client such as a local edge device,
    mobile application, tablet, or any distributed cloud environment
    where ML models are trained in a distributed manner and sent to an
    aggregator. The agent can be connected to an FL server of the
    aggregator through the FL client-side communications module. The FL
    client-side codes contain a collection of libraries that can be
    integrated into the local ML application, which is designed and
    implemented by individual ML engineers and data scientists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Database server</strong> (or <strong>database</strong>): A database and its server to
    store the data related to the aggregators, agents, and global and
    local ML models and their performance metrics. The database server
    handles the incoming queries from the aggregators and sends the
    necessary data back to the aggregators. Agents do not have to be
    connected to the database server directly for the simplicity of the
    FL system design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-3-1" name="__codelineno-3-1" href="#__codelineno-3-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;

-   <em>Figure 3.1</em> shows the typical overall architecture consisting of a
    single cluster aggregator and a database server, as well as multiple
    distributed agents:</p>

<p>Figure 3.1 -- Overall architecture of an FL system</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One advantage of the FL system's architecture is that users do not
    have to send private raw data to the server, especially that owned
    by a third party. Instead, they only have to send locally trained
    models to the aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The locally trained models can be in a variety of formats such as
    the weights of the entire ML models, the changes of weights
    (gradients), or even a subset of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another advantage includes reducing the communication load because
    the users only have to exchange models that are usually much lighter
    than raw data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Cluster aggregators</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A cluster aggregator consists of an FL server module, FL state
    manager module, and model aggregation module, as in <em>Figure 3.1</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We just call a cluster aggregator with an FL server an aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While these modules are the foundation of the aggregator, advanced
    modules can be added to ensure further security and flexibility of
    the aggregation of ML models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the advanced modules are not implemented in
    the simple-fl GitHub repository provided with exercises because the
    main purpose of this effort is to understand the basic structure and
    system flow of the FL system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the aggregator system, the following modules related to the FL
    server, the state manager of FL, and model aggregation are the keys
    to implementing the aggregator-side functionalities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-4-1" name="__codelineno-4-1" href="#__codelineno-4-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   <strong>FL server module</strong>: There are three primary functionalities for
    the FL server module, which include the communication handler,
    system configuration handler, and model synthesis routine:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>-   **Communication handler**: Serves as a module of the aggregator
    that supports *communications with agents and the database*.
    Usually, this module accepts polling messages from agents and
    sends responses back to them. The types of messages they receive
    include the registration of agents themselves with secure
    credentials and authentication mechanisms, the initialization of
    the ML model that serves as an *initial model* for the future
    aggregation process, confirmation about whether or not agents
    participate in a round, and local ML models that are retrained
    at distributed agents such as mobile devices and local edge
    machines. The communication handler can also query the database
    server in order to access the system data and ML models in the
    database, as well as push and store this data and those models
    once the aggregator receives or creates new models. This module
    can utilize HTTP, WebSocket, or any other communication
    framework for its implementation.

-   **System configuration handler**: Deals with the *registration
    of agents* and tracking the connected agents and their statuses.
    The aggregator needs to be aware of the connections and
    registration statuses of the agents. If the agents are
    registered with an established authentication mechanism, they
    will accept the messages and process them accordingly.
    Otherwise, this module will go through the authentication
    process, such as validating the token sent from the agent, so
    that next time this agent is connected to the FL server, the
    system will recognize the agent properly.

-   **Model synthesis routine**: Supports checking the collection
    status of the local ML models and aggregating them once the
    collection criteria are satisfied. Collection criteria include
    the number of local models collected by the connected agents.
    For example, aggregation can happen when 80% of the connected
    agents send the trained local models to the aggregator. One of
    the design patterns to do so is to periodically check the number
    of ML models uploaded by the agents, which keep running while
    the FL server is up and running. The model synthesis routine
    will access the database or local buffer periodically to check
    the status of the local model collection and aggregate those
    models, to produce the global model that will be stored in the
    database server and sent back to the agents.

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>FL state manager</strong>: A state manager keeps track of the state
    information of an aggregator and connected agents. It stores
    volatile information for an aggregator, such as local and global
    models delivered by agents, cluster models pulled from the database,
    FL round information, or agents connected to the aggregator. The
    buffered local models are used by the model aggregation module to
    generate a global model that is sent back to each active agent
    connected to the aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model aggregation module</strong>: The model aggregation module is a
    collection of the model aggregation algorithms introduced in
    the <em>Basics of model aggregation</em> section here and in <em>Model
    Aggregation</em>, in further depth. The most typical aggregation
    algorithm is <em>federated averaging</em>, which averages the weights of
    the collected ML models, considering the number of samples that each
    model has used for its local training.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Distributed agents</p>
<ul>
<li>A distributed agent consists of an FL client module that includes
    the communication handler and client libraries as well as local ML
    applications connected to the FL system through the FL client
    libraries:</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-5-1" name="__codelineno-5-1" href="#__codelineno-5-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   <strong>FL client module</strong>: There are primarily four key functionalities
    for the FL client module, which include a communication handler,
    agent participation handler, model exchange routine, and client
    libraries:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>-   **Communication handler**: Serves as a channel to communicate
    with the aggregator that is assigned to the agent. The message
    sent to the aggregator includes the registration payload of the
    agent itself and an initial model that will be the basis of
    aggregated models. The message also contains locally trained
    models together with the performance data of those models. This
    module supports both *push* and *polling* mechanisms and can
    utilize HTTP or WebSocket frameworks for its implementation.

-   **FL participation handler**: Deals with the agent participation
    in the FL process and cycle by sending an aggregator a message
    including the agent information itself to be registered in the
    FL platform and initialize the FL process if needed. The
    response message will set the agent up for the continuous and
    ongoing FL process and often includes the most updated global
    model for the agent to utilize and train locally.

-   **Model exchange routine**: Supports a synchronizing
    functionality that constantly checks whether a new global model
    is available or not. If the new global model is available, this
    module downloads the global model from the aggregator and the
    global model replaces the local model if needed. This module
    also checks the client state and sends the retrained model if
    the local training process is done.

-   **Client libraries**: Include administrative libraries and
    general FL client libraries:

    -   The administrative libraries are used when registering the
        initial model that will be used by other agents. Any
        configuration changes for FL systems can be also requested
        by administrative agents that have higher control
        capabilities.

    -   General FL client libraries provide basic functionalities
        such as starting FL client core threads, sending local
        models to an aggregator, saving models in some specific
        location on the local machine, manipulating the client
        state, and downloading the global models. This book mainly
        talks about this general type of library.
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Local ML engine and data pipelines</strong>: These parts are designed by
    individual ML engineers and scientists and can be independent of the
    FL client functionalities. This module has an ML model itself that
    can be put into play immediately by the user for potentially more
    accurate inference, a training and testing environment that can be
    plugged into the FL client libraries, and for the implementation of
    data pipelines. While the aforementioned module and libraries can be
    generalized and provided as <strong>application programming
    interfaces</strong> (<strong>APIs</strong>) or libraries for any ML applications, this
    module is unique depending on the requirements of AI applications to
    be developed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Database Components</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A database server consists of a database query handler and a
    database, as storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The database server can reside on the server side, such as on the
    cloud, and is tied closely to aggregators, while the recommended
    design is to separate this database server from aggregator servers
    to decouple the functionalities to enhance the system's simplicity
    and resilience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The functionality of the database query handler and sample database
    tables are as follows:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-6-1" name="__codelineno-6-1" href="#__codelineno-6-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   <strong>Database query handler</strong>: Accepts the incoming requests from an
    aggregator and sends the requested data and ML models back to the
    aggregator.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Database</strong>: Stores all the related information to FL processes. We
    list some potential entries for the database here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Aggregator information</strong>: This aggregator-related information
    includes the ID of the aggregator itself, the IP address and
    various port numbers, system registered and updated times, and
    system status. In addition, this entry can include model
    aggregation-related information, such as the round of FL and its
    information and aggregation criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Agent information</strong>: This agent-related information includes
    the ID of the agent itself, the IP address and various port
    numbers, system registered and updated times, and system status.
    This entry can also contain the opt-in/out status that is used
    for synchronous FL (explained in the <em>Synchronous and
    asynchronous FL</em> section Here) and a flag to record whether the
    agent has been a bad actor in the past (for example, involved in
    poisoning attacks, or very slow at returning results).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Base model information</strong>: Base model information is used for
    the registration of initial ML models whose architecture and
    information are used for the entire process of FL rounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local models</strong>: The information of local models includes the
    model ID that is unique to individual ML models, generated time
    of the model, agent ID that uploaded the model, aggregator ID
    that received the model from the agent, and so on. Usually, the
    model ID is uniquely mapped to the location of the actual ML
    model file that can be stored in the database server or in some
    cloud storage services such as S3 buckets of Amazon Web
    Services, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cluster global models</strong>: The information of the cluster global
    models is similar to what local models could record in the
    database including the model ID, aggregator ID, generated time
    of the model, and so on. Once the aggregated model is created by
    an aggregator, the database server will accept the global models
    and store them in the database server or any cloud storage
    services. Any global model can be requested by an aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance data</strong>: The performance of the local and global
    models can be tracked, as metadata attached to those models.
    This performance data will be used to ensure that the aggregated
    model performs well enough before it is actually deployed to the
    user ML application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the code sample of the simple-fl repository, only the database
    tables related to the local models and cluster models are covered to
    simplify the explanation of the entire FL process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that the basic architecture of the FL system has been
    introduced, next, we will talk about how to enhance the FL system's
    architecture if the computation resources are limited on the
    agent-side devices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Low Computational Capacity Agent Devices and Intermediate servers</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, the computational capability of local user devices is
    limited -- ML training may be difficult in those devices, but
    inference or predictions can be made possible by just downloading
    the global model. In these cases, an FL platform may be able to set
    up an additional intermediate server layer, such as with
    smartphones, tablets, or edge servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, in a healthcare AI application, users manage their
    health information on their smart watches, which can be transferred
    to their smart tablets or synched with laptops. In those devices, it
    is easy to retrain ML models and integrate the distributed agent
    functionalities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the system architecture needs to be modified or
    redesigned depending on the applications into which the FL system is
    integrated, and the concept of intermediate servers can be applied
    using distributed agents to realize FL processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do not have to modify the interactions and communication
    mechanisms between the aggregators and the intermediate servers.
    Just by implementing APIs between the user devices and the
    intermediate servers, FL will be possible in most use cases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Figure 3.2</em> illustrates the interaction between the aggregators,
intermediate servers, and user devices:</p>

<p>Figure 3.2 -- An FL system with intermediate servers</p>
<ul>
<li>Now that we have learned about the basic architecture and components
    of an FL system, let us look into how an FL system operates in the
    following section.</li>
</ul>
<p>FL System Process -- from initialization to continuous operation</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each distributed agent belongs to an aggregator that is managed by
    an FL server, where ML model aggregation is conducted to synthesize
    a global model that is going to be sent back to the agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An agent uses its local data to train an ML model and then uploads
    the trained model to the corresponding aggregator. The concept
    sounds straightforward, so we will look into a bit more detail to
    realize the entire flow of those processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also define a <strong>cluster global model</strong>, which we simply call
    a <strong>cluster model</strong> or <strong>global model</strong>, which is an aggregated ML
    model of local models collected from distributed agents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the next two sections, we will guide you on how to implement the
    procedure and sequence of messages discussed Here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, some of the system operation perspectives, such as an
    aggregator or agent system registration in the database, are not
    introduced in the code sample of the simple-fl repository in order
    to simplify the explanation of the entire FL process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Database, Aggregator, and Agent initialization</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The sequence of the initialization processes is quite simple. The
    initialization and registration processes need to happen in the
    order of database, aggregator, and agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall registration sequence of an aggregator and an agent with
    a database is depicted in <em>Figure 3.3</em> as follows:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 3.3 -- The process of aggregator and agent registration in the
database server
" src="../images/media/image14.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="6.290972222222222in"}</p>
<p>Figure 3.3 -- The process of aggregator and agent registration in the
database server</p>
<p>Here is the initialization and registration procedure of each component
in the FL system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Database server initialization</strong>: The first step of the operation
    of an FL system is to initiate the database server. There are some
    simple frameworks that are provided by multiple organizations that
    do not include databases or database servers. However, in order to
    maintain the process of federating the ML models, it is recommended
    that you use a database, even a lightweight one such as an SQLite
    database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aggregator initialization and registration</strong>: An aggregator should
    be set up and running before any agents start running and uploading
    the ML models. When the aggregator starts running and first gets
    connected to the database server, the registration process happens
    automatically by also checking whether the aggregator is safe to be
    connected. If it fails to go through the registration process, it
    receives the registration failure message sent back from the
    database. Also, in case the aggregator is trying to connect to
    the database again after losing the connection to the database, the
    database server always checks whether the aggregator has already
    been registered or not. If this is the case, the response from the
    database server includes the system information of the registered
    aggregator so that the aggregator can start from the point where it
    left off. The aggregator may need to publish an IP address and port
    number for agents to be connected if it uses HTTP or WebSocket.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Agent initialization and registration</strong>: Usually, if an agent
    knows the aggregator that the agent wants to connect to, the
    registration is similar to how an aggregator connects to a database
    server. The connection process should be straightforward enough to
    just send a participation message to that aggregator using an IP
    address, the port number of the aggregator (if we are using some
    frameworks such as HTTP or WebSocket), and an authentication token.
    In case the agent is trying to connect to the aggregator again after
    losing the connection to the aggregator, the database server always
    checks whether the agent already has been registered or not. If the
    agent is already registered, the response from the database server
    includes the system information of the registered agent so that the
    agent can start from the point where it was disconnected from the
    aggregator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-7-1" name="__codelineno-7-1" href="#__codelineno-7-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   In particular, when it receives the participation message from the
    agent, the aggregator goes through the following procedure, as
    in <em>Figure 3.4</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The key process after receiving the participation request is (i)
    checking whether the agent is trusted or not, or whether the agent
    is already registered or not, and (ii) checking whether the initial
    global model is already registered or not. If (i) is met, the
    registration process keeps going. If the (initial) global model is
    already registered, the agent will be able to receive the global
    model and start using that global model for the local training
    process on the agent side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agent participation and registration process at an aggregator
    side is depicted in <em>Figure 3.4</em>:</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Figure 3.4 -- The registration process of an agent by an aggregator</p>
<ul>
<li>Now that we understand the initialization and registration process
    of the FL system components, let us move on to the basic
    configuration of the ongoing FL process, which is about uploading
    the initial ML model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Initial model upload process by initial agent</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The next step in running an FL process is to register the initial ML
    model whose architecture will be used in the entire and continuous
    process of FL by all the aggregators and agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The initial model can be distributed by the company that owns the ML
    application and FL servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They'll likely provide the initial base model as part of the
    aggregator configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We call the initial ML model used as a reference for model
    aggregation a <strong>base model</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also call the agent that uploads the initial base model
    an <em>initial agent</em>. The base model info could include the ML model
    itself as well as the time it was generated and the initial
    performance data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That being said, the process of initializing the base model can be
    seen in <em>Figure 3.5</em>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 3.5 -- Base model upload process for the initial agent

<p>Figure 3.5 -- Base model upload process for the initial agent</p>
<ul>
<li>Now, the FL process is ready to be conducted. Next, we will learn
    about the FL cycle, which is a very core part of the FL process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall FL System Process Sequence</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this section, we will only give an example with a single agent
    and aggregator, but in real cases and operations, the agent
    environments are various and dispersed into distributed devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following is the list of the processes for how the local models
    are uploaded, aggregated, stored, and sent back to agents as a
    global model:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agents other than the initial agent will request the global
    model, which is an updated aggregated ML model, in order to deploy
    it to their own applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the agent gets the updated model from the aggregator and
    deploys it, the agent retrains the ML model locally with new data
    that is obtained afterward to reflect the freshness and timeliness
    of the data. An agent can also participate in multiple rounds with
    different data to absorb its local examples and tendencies. Again,
    this local data will not be shared with the aggregator and stays
    local to the distributed devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After retraining the local ML model (which, of course, has the same
    architecture as the global or base model of the FL), the agent calls
    an FL client API to send the model to the aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aggregator receives the local ML model and pushes the model to
    the database. The aggregator keeps track of the number of collected
    local models and will keep accepting the local models as long as the
    federation round is open. The round can be closed with any defined
    criteria, such as the aggregator receiving enough ML models to be
    aggregated. When the criteria are met, the aggregator aggregates the
    local models and produces an updated global model that is ready to
    be sent back to the agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During that process, agents constantly poll the aggregator on
    whether the global model is ready or not, or in some cases, the
    aggregator may push the global model to the agents that are
    connected to the aggregator, depending on the communications system
    design and network constraints. Then, the updated model is sent back
    to the agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After receiving the updated global model, the agent deploys and
    retrains the global model locally whenever it is ready. The whole
    process described is repeated until the termination criteria are met
    for the FL to end. In some cases, there are no termination
    conditions to stop this FL cycle and retraining process so that the
    global model constantly keeps learning about the latest phenomena,
    current trends, or user-related tendencies. FL rounds can just be
    stopped manually in preparation for some evaluation before a
    rollout.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Figure 3.6</em> shows the overall process of how FL is continuously
conducted between an agent, an aggregator, and a database typically:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3.6 -- Overview of the continuous FL cycle

height="6.572222222222222in"}</p>
<p>Figure 3.6 -- Overview of the continuous FL cycle</p>
<ul>
<li>Now that we understand the overall procedure of the FL process, we
    will look into the different round management approaches in the FL
    process next: synchronous FL and asynchronous FL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronous and asynchronous FL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the model aggregation happens at the aggregator, there are
    multiple criteria related to how many local models it needs to
    collect from which agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this section, we will briefly talk about the differences between
    synchronous and asynchronous FL, which have been discussed in a lot
    of literature, such as
    https://iqua.ece.toronto.edu/papers/ningxinsu-iwqos22.pdf, so please
    refer to it to learn about these concepts further.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronous FL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Synchronous FL requires the aggregator to select the agents that
    need to send the local models for each round in order to proceed
    with the model aggregation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This synchronous FL approach is simple to design and implement
    and suitable for FL applications that require a clear selection
    of agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, if the number of agents becomes too large, the
    aggregator may have to wait for a long time to wrap up the
    current round, as the computational capability of the agents
    could vary and some of them may have problems uploading or fail
    to upload their local models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, some of the agents can become slow or totally
    dysfunctional when sending their models to the aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These slow agents are known as <em>stragglers</em> in distributed ML,
    which motivates us to use the asynchronous FL mode.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Asynchronous FL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Asynchronous FL does not require the aggregator to select the agents
    that have to upload their local models. Instead, it opens the door
    for any trusted agents to upload the model anytime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, it is fine to wrap up the federation round whenever the
    aggregator wants to generate the global model, with or without
    criteria such as the minimum number of local models that needs to be
    collected, or some predefined interval or deadline for which the
    aggregator needs to wait to receive the local models from the agents
    until the aggregation for that round happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This asynchronous FL approach gives the FL system much more
    flexibility for model aggregation for each FL round, but the design
    may be more complicated than the simple synchronous aggregation
    framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When managing the FL rounds, you need to consider the practicalities
    of running rounds, such as scheduling and dealing with delayed
    responses, the minimum levels of participation required, the details
    of example stores, using the downloaded or trained models for
    improved inference in the applications on the edge devices, and
    dealing with bad or slow agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will look into the FL process and procedure flow next, focusing
    on the aggregator side.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FL cycle and process- The aggregator perspective</p>
<ul>
<li>An aggregator has two threads running to accept and cache the local
    models and aggregate the collected local ML models. In this section,
    we describe those procedures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Accepting and caching local ML models</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The aggregator side process of accepting and caching local ML models
    is depicted in <em>Figure 3.7</em> and explained as follows:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aggregator will wait for a local ML model to be uploaded by an
    agent. This method sounds like asynchronous FL. However, if the
    aggregator has already decided which agents to accept models from,
    it just needs to exclude the model uploads sent by undesired agents.
    Some other system or module may have already told the undesired
    agents not to participate in the round as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once an ML model is received, the aggregator checks whether the
    model is uploaded by the trusted agents or not. Also, if the agent
    that uploads the local model is not listed in the agents that the FL
    operator wants to accept, the aggregator will discard the model.
    Furthermore, an aggregator needs to have a mechanism to only filter
    the valid models -- otherwise, there is a risk of poisoning the
    global model and messing up the entire FL process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the uploaded local ML model is valid, the aggregator will push
    the model to the database. If the database resides on a different
    server, the aggregator will package the model and send it to the
    database server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the uploaded models are stored in the database, they should be
    buffered in the memory of the state manager of the aggregator in an
    appropriate format, such as NumPy arrays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This procedure keeps running until the termination conditions are
    satisfied or the operator of the FL system opts to stop the
    process. <em>Figure 3.7</em> depicts the procedure of accepting and caching
    local ML models:</p>
</li>

<li>Once the local ML models are accepted and cached, the FL system
    moves on to the next procedure: aggregating the local models.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aggregating local ML models</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The aggregator-side procedure of aggregating local ML models
    depicted in <em>Figure 3.8</em> is as follows:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aggregator constantly checks whether the aggregation criteria
    are satisfied. The typical aggregation criteria are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The number of local models collected so far in this FL round.
    For example, if the number of agents is 10 nodes, after 8 nodes
    (meaning 80% nodes) report the locally trained models, the
    aggregator starts aggregating the models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The combination of the number of collected models and the time
    that the FL round has spent. This can automate the aggregation
    process and prevent systems from getting stuck.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the aggregation criteria are met, the aggregator starts a model
    aggregation process. Usually, federated averaging is a very typical
    but powerful aggregation method. Further explanation of the model
    aggregation methods is in the <em>Basics of model aggregation</em> section
    of This section and in <a href="https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/data/9781803247106/4/ch04lvl1sec23/B18369_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor176"><em>section
    7</em></a>, <em>Model
    Aggregation</em>. The aggregated model is defined as a global model in
    this FL round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a case where time for the FL round has expired and not enough
    agents that participated in the round have uploaded a model, the
    round can be abandoned or forced to conduct aggregation for the
    local models collected so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the model aggregation is complete, the aggregator pushes the
    aggregated global model to the database. If the database resides on
    a different server, the aggregator will package the global model and
    send it to the database server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, the aggregator sends the global model to all the agents, or
    when the agents poll to check whether the global model is ready, the
    aggregator will notify the agent that the global model is ready and
    put it in the response message to the agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the whole process of model aggregation, the aggregator updates
    the number of the FL round by just incrementing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Figure 3.8</em> shows the aggregator's process from checking the
    aggregation criteria to synthesizing the global model when enough
    models are collected:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aggregating local models to generate the global model has been
    explained. Now, let us look into the agent-side FL cycle, including
    the retraining process of the local ML models.</li>
</ul>
<p>Local Retraining Cycle - The agent-perspective</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the distributed agent, the following state transition happens and
    is repeated for the continuous operation of the FL cycle:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the state of waiting_gm, the agent polls the aggregator to
    receive any updates related to the global model. Basically, a
    polling method is used to regularly query the updated global model.
    However, under some specific settings, an aggregator can push the
    updated global model to all agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gm_ready is the state after the global model is formed by the
    aggregator and downloaded by the agent. The model parameters are
    cached in the agent device. The agent replaces its local ML model
    with the downloaded global model. Before completely replacing the
    local model with the downloaded model, the agent can check whether
    the output of the global model is sufficiently performant for the
    local ML engine. If the performance is not what is expected, the
    user can keep using the old model locally until it receives the
    global model that has the desired performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, in the training state, the agent can locally train the model
    in order to maximize its performance. The trained model is saved in
    a local data storage where training examples are kept. The FL client
    libraries of the agent ascertain its readiness to manipulate the
    local model that can be protected with asynchronous function access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the local model is trained, the agent checks whether the new
    global model has been sent to the agent or not. If the global model
    has arrived, then the locally trained ML model is discarded and goes
    back to the gm_ready state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After local training, the agent proceeds with the sending state to
    send the updated local model back to the aggregator, and then, the
    agent goes back to the waiting_gm state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Figure 3.9</em> depicts the state transition of an agent to adapt and
    update the ML model:</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Next, we touch on a model interpretation based on deviation from the
    baseline outputs that are used for anomaly detection and preventing
    model degradation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Model interpretation based on deviation from baseline outputs</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can also provide an interpretation framework by looking at the
    output of each local model. The following procedure can be
    considered to ensure the local model is always good to use and can
    be deployed in production:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain the most recent ML output generated by an agent as well as a
    baseline output that can be a typical desired output prepared by
    users. The baseline output could include an average output based on
    the past windows or reference points defined by an operator, subject
    expert, or rule-based algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The deviation between the output of the local model and the baseline
    output is computed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An anomaly or performance degradation can be detected by checking
    whether the deviation exceeds the operator-specified threshold. If
    an anomaly is detected, an alarm can be sent to an operator to
    indicate a fault or that the ML model is in an anomalous state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that the process of the FL has been explained, let us look into
    the basics of model aggregation, which comprise the critical part of
    FL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Model Aggregation - The Basics</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aggregation is a core concept within FL. In fact, the strategies
    employed to aggregate models are the key theoretical driver for the
    performance of FL systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purpose of this section is to introduce the high-level concepts
    of aggregation within the context of an FL system -- the underlying
    theory and examples of advanced aggregation strategies will be
    discussed in greater depth later when we discuss <em>Model
    Aggregation</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What does aggregation of models mean?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let's revisit the aggregator-side cycle discussed in earlier, at the
    point in the process where the agents assigned to a certain
    aggregator have finished training locally and have transmitted these
    models back to this aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal of any aggregation strategy, or any way of aggregating
    these models together, is to produce new models that gradually
    increase in performance across all of the data collected by the
    constituent agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An important point to remember is that FL is, by definition, a
    restricted version of the distributed learning setting, in which the
    data collected locally by each agent cannot be directly accessed by
    other agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this restriction were not in place, a model could be made to
    perform well trivially on all of the data by collecting the data
    from each agent and training on the joint dataset; thus, it makes
    sense to treat this <em>centrally-trained</em> model as the target model
    for an FL approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a high level, we can consider this unrestricted distributed
    learning scenario as aggregation before model training (where in
    this case, aggregation refers to combining the data from each
    agent).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because FL does not allow data to be accessed by other agents, we
    consider the scenario as aggregation after model training instead;
    in this context, aggregation refers to the combination of the
    intelligence captured by each of the trained models from their
    differing local datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To summarize, the goal of an aggregation strategy is to combine
    models in a way that eventually leads to a generalized model whose
    performance approaches that of the respective centrally trained
    model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FedAvg -- Federated averaging</p>
<ul>
<li>To make some of these ideas more concrete, let's take an initial
    look into one of the most well-known and straightforward aggregation
    strategies, known as <strong>Federated Averaging</strong> (<strong>FedAvg</strong>). The
    FedAvg algorithm is performed as follows:
    let <img alt="" src="../images/media/image23.png" />{width="1.2670089676290464in"
    height="0.2487379702537183in"} be the parameters of the models
    from <img alt="" src="../images/media/image35.png" />{width="0.20833333333333334in"
    height="0.20833333333333334in"} agents, each with a local dataset
    size
    of <img alt="" src="../images/media/image6.png" />{width="1.1828608923884514in"
    height="0.2213538932633421in"}.
    Also, <img alt="" src="../images/media/image12.png" />{width="0.20833333333333334in"
    height="0.20833333333333334in"} is the total dataset size defined
    as <img alt="" src="../images/media/image9.png" />{width="2.617024278215223in"
    height="0.29885826771653545in"}. Then, FedAvg returns the following
    ML model as the aggregated model:</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/media/image1.jpg" />{width="4.697647637795275in"
height="0.54582239720035in"}</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Essentially, we perform FedAvg over a set of models by taking the
    weighted average of the models, with weights proportional to the
    size of the dataset used to train the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, the types of models to which FedAvg can be applied are
    models that can be represented as some set of parameter values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deep neural networks are currently the most notable of these kinds
    of models -- most of the results analyzing the performance of FedAvg
    work with deep learning models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is rather surprising that this relatively simple approach can
    lead to generalization in the resulting model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can visually examine what FedAvg looks like within a toy
    two-dimensional parameter space to observe the benefits of the
    aggregation strategy:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 3.10 -- Two-dimensional parameter space with local models from
two agents (the circle and square) and a target model (the black x)
" src="../images/media/image5.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="4.636111111111111in"}</p>
<p>Figure 3.10 -- Two-dimensional parameter space with local models from
two agents (the circle and square) and a target model (the black x)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let's consider a case where we have two newly initialized models
    (the circle and square points) belonging to separate agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The space in the preceding figure represents the parameter space of
    the models, where each toy model is defined by two parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the models are trained, these points will move in the parameter
    space -- the goal is to approach a local optimum in the parameter
    space, generally corresponding to the aforementioned centrally
    trained model:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 3.11 -- Change in local model parameters without aggregation
" src="../images/media/image57.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="4.461111111111111in"}</p>
<p>Figure 3.11 -- Change in local model parameters without aggregation</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each model converges to separate dataset-specific optima (two x
    points from the circle and square) that do not generalize.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because each agent only has access to a subset of the data, the
    local optima reached by training each model locally will differ from
    the true local optima; this difference depends on how similar the
    underlying data distributions are for each agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the models are only trained locally, the resulting models will
    likely not generalize over all of the data:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 3.12 -- Adding aggregation moves the local model parameters to
the average for both models at each step, leading to convergence at the
target model " src="../images/media/image4.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="4.631944444444445in"}</p>
<p>Figure 3.12 -- Adding aggregation moves the local model parameters to
the average for both models at each step, leading to convergence at the
target model</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Applying FedAvg at each movement step allows us to create an
    aggregate model that eventually comes close to the true local optima
    in the parameter space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This example displays the basic capability of FedAvg to produce
    generalized models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, working with real models (such as highly parameterized deep
    learning models) introduces additional complexity that is handled by
    FedAvg but not by simpler approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, we might wonder why we don't simply fully train each
    local model and only average at the end; while this approach would
    work in this toy case, it has been observed that only averaging once
    with real models leads to poor performance across all of the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FedAvg process allows for a more robust way to reach the
    generalized model within high-dimension parameter spaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section only aims to give an overview of aggregation in
    FL; the <em>Model Aggregation</em> section, contains more detailed
    explanations and examples for aggregation in different scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We now understand the entire process of how the FL system works with
    basic model aggregation. In some applications, the FL system may
    have to support a huge number of agents to realize its scalability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following section will give you some idea about how to scale
    more smoothly, especially with a decentralized horizontal design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Horizontal Design for Enhanced Scalability</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this section, we will look into how to further scalability when
    we need to support a large number of devices and users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are practical cases where control, ease of maintenance and
    deployment, and low communication overhead are provided by
    centralized FL. If the number of agents is not large, it makes more
    sense to stick to centralized FL than decentralized FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, when the number of participating agents becomes quite
    large, it may be worth looking into horizontal scaling with a
    decentralized FL architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The latest developments of auto-scaling frameworks these days, such
    as the <strong>Kubernetes</strong> framework (https://kubernetes.io/, can be a
    nice integration with the topic that is discussed in this section,
    although actual integration and implementation with Kubernetes is
    beyond the scope of this material.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Horizontal design with semi-global model</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There will be some use cases where many aggregators are needed to
    cluster groups of agents and create a global model on top of those
    many aggregators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google uses a centralized approach for this, as in the
    paper <em>Towards Federated Learning at Scale</em>, while setting up a
    centralized node for managing multiple aggregators may have some
    resilience issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea is simple: periodically aggregate all the cluster models at
    some central master node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, we can realize the decentralized way of
    aggregating cluster models created by multiple aggregators. The
    architecture for that is based on two crucial ideas:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-8-1" name="__codelineno-8-1" href="#__codelineno-8-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Model aggregation conducted among individual cluster aggregators
    without master nodes</p>
<ul>
<li>Semi-global model synthesis to aggregate cluster models generated by
    other aggregators</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-9-1" name="__codelineno-9-1" href="#__codelineno-9-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   To create semi-global models, decentralized cluster aggregators
    exchange their aggregated cluster models with each other and
    approximate optimal global models.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The cluster aggregators can also use a database to periodically
    collect other cluster models to generate the semi-global models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This framework allows for the absorption of training results from
    diverse sets of users dispersed across many aggregators by
    synthesizing the most updated global models without a master node
    concept.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on this decentralized architecture, the robustness of the
    entire FL system can be enhanced, as the semi-global model can be
    independently computed at each cluster aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FL system can be scaled further, as each cluster aggregator is
    responsible for creating its own semi-global model by itself -- not
    via the master node of those aggregators -- and therefore,
    decentralized semi-global model formation comes with resiliency and
    mobility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can even decouple the database that stores the uploaded local
    models, cluster global models, and semi-global models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By introducing a distributed database into the FL system, the entire
    system could be made more scalable, resilient, and secure together
    with some failover mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, each cluster aggregator stores the cluster model in a
    distributed database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cluster aggregators can retrieve cluster models of other
    aggregators by pulling the models periodically from the databases.
    At each cluster aggregator, a semi-global ML model is generated by
    synthesizing the pulled models.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Figure 3.13</em> illustrates the overall architecture of the decentralized
horizontal design of a multi-aggregator FL system:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 3.13 -- Architecture of a decentralized FL system with multiple
aggregators (horizontal design)

height="2.0625in"}</p>
<p>Figure 3.13 -- Architecture of a decentralized FL system with multiple
aggregators (horizontal design)</p>
<ul>
<li>Now that we have discussed how to enhance the FL system with a
    horizontal design using the semi-global model concept, next, we will
    look at distributed database frameworks to further ensure
    scalability and resiliency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Distributed database</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, the accountability of the model updates can be provided
    by storing historical model data in a data-driven distributed
    database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>InterPlanetary File System</strong> (<strong>IPFS</strong>) and Blockchain
    are well-known distributed databases that ensure the accountability
    of global model updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a cluster aggregator generates a semi-global model based on
    other cluster models, the semi-global model is stored in a
    distributed database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distributed database manages the information of those models
    with a unique identifier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To maintain all the models consistently, including local, cluster,
    and semi-global models, each ML model is assigned a globally unique
    identifier, such as a hash value, which could be realized using the
    concept of a <strong>Chord Distributed Hash Table</strong> (<strong>Chord DHT</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Chord DHT is a scalable peer-to-peer lookup protocol for
    internet applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cluster aggregator can store metadata on the cluster models,
    such as timestamps and hash identifiers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This gives us further accountability for model synthesis by ensuring
    the cluster models haven\'t been altered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also possible to identify a set of aggregators that are
    sending harmful cluster models to destroy the semi-global models
    once the malicious models are detectable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These models can be filtered by analyzing the patterns of the
    weights of the cluster model or deviation from the other cluster
    models when the difference is too big to rely on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nature of the distributed database is to store all the volatile
    state information of the distributed FL system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FL system can restore from the distributed database in the case
    of failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cluster aggregators also exchange their cluster models based on
    a certain interval defined by the system operator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the mapping table between cluster models and aggregators
    needs to be logged in the database together with meta-information on
    the local, cluster, and semi-global models, such as the generation
    time of those models and the size of training samples.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Asynchronous agent participation in a multiple-aggregator scenario</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Distributed agents can broadcast participation messages to
    connectable aggregators when they want to join their FL process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The participation messages can contain the unique ID of the agent.
    One of the cluster aggregators then returns a cluster aggregator ID,
    potentially the value generated based on a common hash function, to
    which the agent should belong. </p>

    aggregator using a hash function:</p>

</ul>
<p>Semi-global model synthesis</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After the agent is assigned to a specific cluster aggregator, the
    agent starts to participate in the FL process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It requests a base ML model if it is registered -- otherwise, it
    needs to upload the base model to start local training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The procedure of uploading local models and generating cluster and
    semi-global models will continue until the agent or aggregator is
    disconnected from the system.</p>
</li>

    aggregation process, and semi-global model synthesis and pulling is
    illustrated in <em>Figure 3.15</em>:</p>

<li>
<p>Let's look at semi-global model synthesis using the flowchart
    between the agent, aggregator, and distributed database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aggregator receives a local model from an agent. When receiving
    the local model, the model filtering process will decide whether to
    accept the uploaded model or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This framework can be implemented using many different methods, such
    as a basic scheme of checking the difference between the weights of
    the global and local models. If the model is not valid, just discard
    the local model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, a cluster model is created by aggregating all the accepted
    local models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aggregator stores the cluster model in a database, as well as
    simultaneously retrieving the cluster models generated by other
    cluster aggregators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A semi-global model is then synthesized from those cluster models
    and will be used in the agents that are assigned to the cluster
    aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Figure 3.16</em> shows how the cluster aggregator proceeds with cluster
    and semi-global model synthesis using a distributed database:</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Figure 3.16 -- The procedure and flow of semi-global model synthesis</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An aggregator does not need to retrieve all the cluster models
    generated at each round to create a semi-global model. To synthesize
    a semi-global model, the global model can eventually converge based
    on the subset of models randomly selected by each aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using this approach, the robustness and independence of aggregators
    will be enhanced by compromising on the conditions to create the
    global model at every update.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This framework can also resolve the bottlenecks in terms of
    computation and communication typical to centralized FL systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here, we discussed the potential architecture, procedure flow, and
    message sequences within an FL system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The typical FL system architecture consists of an aggregator,
    agents, and a database server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These three components are constantly communicating with each other
    to exchange system information and ML models to achieve model
    aggregation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key to implementing a good FL system is decoupling the critical
    components and carefully designing the interfaces between them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We focused on the aspect of the simplicity of its design so that
    further enhancement can be achieved by just adding additional
    components to the systems. Horizontal decentralized design can also
    help implement a scalable FL system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the following section, we will discuss the implementation details
    of achieving FL on the server side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As some critical aspects of the functionalities have been introduced
    Here, you will be able to implement the basic system and smoothly
    run the simulation with some ML applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[Section 4: FL Server - Python Implementation]{.underline}</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The server-side implementation of a <strong>federated learning</strong> (<strong>FL</strong>)
    system is critical for realizing authentic FL-enabled applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have discussed the basic system architecture and flow in the
    previous section. Here, more hands-on implementation will be
    discussed so that you can create a simple server and aggregator of
    the FL system that various <strong>machine learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>)
    applications can be connected to and tested on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This section describes an actual implementation aspect of FL
    server-side components discussed in <em>section 3</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the understanding of how the entire process of the FL
    system works, you will be able to go one step further to make it
    happen with example code provided here and on GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you understand the basic implementation principles using the
    example code, it is a fun aspect to be able enhance the FL server
    functionalities based on your own design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, we're going to cover the following topics:</p>

</ul>
<p>Main software components of the aggregator  and database</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The architecture of an aggregator with the FL server was introduced
    in the previous section. Here, we will introduce the code that
    realizes the basic functionalities of an FL system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aggregator and database-side Python-based software components
    are listed in the aggregator directory of fl_main, as well
    as lib/util and pseudodb folders, as in <em>Figure 4.1</em>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 4.1 -- Python software components for the aggregator as well as
internal libraries and pseudo database

<p>Figure 4.1 -- Python software components for the aggregator as well as
internal libraries and pseudo database</p>
<ul>
<li>The following is a brief description of the Python code files in the
    aggregator.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Aggregator-side code</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this section, we will touch on the main Python files of the
    aggregator-side related to the FL server thread, FL state manager,
    and model aggregation itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These aggregator-side code files are found in the aggregator folder.
    The code in the repo only captures the model aggregation
    perspective, not the entire engineering aspects of creating a
    thorough FL platform.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FL server code (server_th.py)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is the main code that realizes the whole basic flow of the FL
    process from the communication processes between an aggregator
    itself, agents, and a database to coordinating agent participation
    and the aggregation of the ML models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also initializes the global cluster model sent from the first
    connected agent. It manages receiving local models and the cluster
    model synthesis routine in which the cluster global model is formed
    after collecting enough local models.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FL state manager (state_manager.py)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The state manager buffers the local model and cluster model data
    that is needed for aggregation processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The buffers will be filled out when the aggregator receives local
    models from the agents and cleared when proceeding to the next round
    of the FL process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The checking function of the aggregation criteria is also defined in
    this file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Aggregation code (aggregation.py)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The aggregation Python code will list the basic algorithms for
    aggregating the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the code example used here Here, we will only introduce the
    averaging method called <strong>federated averaging</strong> (<strong>FedAvg</strong>),
    which averages the weights of the collected local models considering
    local dataset sizes to generate a cluster global model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>lib/util codes</p>
<ul>
<li>The Python files for the internal libraries
    (communication_handler.py, data_struc.py, helpers.py, messengers.py,
    and states.py) will be explained in the <em>Appendix</em>, <em>Exploring
    Internal Libraries</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Database-side code</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Database-side code consists of the pseudo database and the SQLite
    database Python code files that can be found in the pseudodb folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pseudo database code is hosting a server to receive messages
    from the aggregator and parse them to process as the ML model data
    that can be utilized for the FL process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pseudo database code (pseudo_db.py)</p>
<ul>
<li>The function of pseudo database Python code is to accept the
    messages related to the local and global cluster models from the
    aggregator and push the information to the database. It also saves
    the ML model binary files in the local file system.</li>
</ul>
<p>SQLite database code (sqlite_db.py)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The SQLite database Python code creates an actual SQLite database at
    the specified path. It also has the function to insert data entries
    related to the local and global cluster models into the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that the aggregator and database-side software components are
    defined, let\'s move on to the configuration of the aggregator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuring the aggregator</p>
<ul>
<li>The following code is an example of the aggregator-side
    configuration parameters defined in the config_aggregator.json file,
    which can be found in the setups folder:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>{</p>
<p>\"aggr_ip\": \"localhost\",</p>
<p>\"db_ip\": \"localhost\",</p>
<p>\"reg_socket\": \"8765\",</p>
<p>\"exch_socket\": \"7890\",</p>
<p>\"recv_socket\": \"4321\",</p>
<p>\"db_socket\": \"9017\",</p>
<p>\"round_interval\": 5,</p>
<p>\"aggregation_threshold\": 1.0,</p>
<p>\"polling\": 1</p>
<p>}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The parameters include the aggregator's IP (the FL server's IP), the
    database server's IP, and the various port numbers of the database
    and agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The round interval is the time of the interval at which the criteria
    of aggregation are checked and the aggregation threshold defines the
    percentage of collected local ML models needed to start the
    aggregation process. The polling flag is related to whether to
    utilize the polling method for communications between the aggregator
    and agents or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we have covered the concept of the configuration file for
    the aggregator side, let's move on to how the code is designed and
    implemented.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FL server-side functions</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this section, we will explain how you can implement the very
    first version of an aggregator with an FL server system using the
    actual code examples, which are in server_th.py in
    the aggregator directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This way, you will understand the core functionalities of the FL
    server system and how they are implemented so that you can further
    enhance a lot more functionalities on your own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, we will only cover the important and core functionalities
    that are critical to conducting a simple FL process. The potential
    enhancements will be listed in the later section of This
    section, <em>Potential enhancements to the FL server</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>server_th.py handles all the aspects of basic functionalities
    related to the FL server side, so let's look into that in the
    following section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FL Server Library Imports</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The FL server-side code starts with importing the necessary
    libraries. In particular, lib.util handles the basic supporting
    functionalities to make the implementation of FL easy. The details
    of the code can be found in the GitHub repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server code imports StateManager and Aggregator for the FL
    processes. The code about the state manager and aggregation will be
    discussed in later sections Here about <em>Maintaining models for
    aggregation with the state manager </em>and<em> Aggregating local models.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here is the code for importing the necessary libraries:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>import asyncio, logging, time, numpy as np</p>
<p>from typing import List, Dict, Any</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.communication_handler import init_fl_server,
send, send_websocket, receive</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.data_struc import convert_LDict_to_Dict</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.helpers import read_config, set_config_file</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.messengers import generate_db_push_message,
generate_ack_message, generate_cluster_model_dist_message,
generate_agent_participation_confirmation_message</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.states import ParticipateMSGLocation,
ModelUpMSGLocation, PollingMSGLocation, ModelType, AgentMsgType</p>
<p>from .state_manager import StateManager</p>
<p>from .aggregation import Aggregator</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>After we import the necessary libraries, let us move on to designing
    an FL Server class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining the FL Server class</p>
<ul>
<li>In practice, it is wise to define the Server class, using which you
    can create an instance of the FL server that has the functionalities
    discussed in <em>earlier</em>, as follows:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>class Server:</p>
<p>\"\"\"</p>
<p>FL Server class defining the functionalities of</p>
<p>agent registration, global model synthesis, and</p>
<p>handling mechanisms of messages by agents.</p>
<p>\"\"\"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Again, the server class primarily provides the functionalities of
    agent registration and global model synthesis and handles the
    mechanisms of uploaded local models and polling messages sent from
    agents. It also serves as the interface between the aggregator and
    database and between the aggregator and agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FL server class functionality is now clear -- next is
    initializing and configuring the server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Initializing the FL server</p>
<ul>
<li>The following code inside the __init__ constructor is an example
    of the initialization process of the Server instance:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def __init__(self):</p>
<p>config_file = set_config_file(\"aggregator\")</p>
<p>self.config = read_config(config_file)</p>
<p>self.sm = StateManager()</p>
<p>self.agg = Aggregator(self.sm)</p>
<p>self.aggr_ip = self.config[\'aggr_ip\']</p>
<p>self.reg_socket = self.config[\'reg_socket\']</p>
<p>self.recv_socket = self.config[\'recv_socket\']</p>
<p>self.exch_socket = self.config[\'exch_socket\']</p>
<p>self.db_ip = self.config[\'db_ip\']</p>
<p>self.db_socket = self.config[\'db_socket\']</p>
<p>self.round_interval = self.config[\'round_interval\']</p>
<p>self.is_polling = bool(self.config[\'polling\'])</p>
<p>self.sm.agg_threshold =</p>
<p>self.config[\'aggregation_threshold\']</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Then, self.config stores the information from
    the config_aggregator.json file discussed in the preceding code
    block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self.sm and self.agg have instances of the state manager class and
    aggregator class discussed as follows, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self.aggr_ip reads an IP address from the aggregator's configuration
    file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, reg_socket and recv_socket will be set up, where reg_socket is
    used for agents to register themselves together with an aggregator
    IP address stored as self.aggr_ip, and recv_socket is used for
    receiving local models from agents, together with an aggregator IP
    address stored as self.aggr_ip. Both reg_socket and recv_socket in
    this example code can be read from the aggregator's configuration
    file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exch_socket is the port number used to send the global model
    back to the agent together with the agent IP address, which is
    initialized with the configuration parameter in the initialization
    process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The information to get connected to the database server will then be
    configured, where dp_ip and db_socket will be the IP address and the
    port number of the database server, respectively, all read from
    the config_aggregator.json file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>round_interval is an interval time to check whether the aggregation
    criteria for starting the model aggregation process are met or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The is_polling flag is related to whether to use the polling method
    from the agents or not. The polling flag must be the same as the one
    used in the agent-side configuration file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>agg_threshold is also the percentage over the number of collected
    local models that is used in
    the ready_for_local_aggregation function where if the percentage of
    the collected models is equal to or more than agg_threshold, the FL
    server starts the aggregation process of the local models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both self.round_interval and self.agg_threshold are read from the
    configuration file in this example code too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that the configuration has been set up, we will talk about how
    to register agents that are trying to participate in the FL process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Agent Registration</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this section, the simplified and asynchronous register function
    is described to receive the participation message specifying the
    model structures and return socket information for future model
    exchanges. It also sends the welcome message back to the agent as a
    response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The registration process of agents is described in the following
    example code:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>async def register(self, websocket: str, path):        </p>
<p>msg = await receive(websocket)</p>
<p>es = self._get_exch_socket(msg)</p>
<p>agent_nm = msg[int(ParticipateMSGLocation.agent_name)]</p>
<p>agent_id = msg[int(ParticipateMSGLocation.agent_id)]</p>
<p>ip = msg[int(ParticipateMSGLocation.agent_ip)]</p>
<p>id, es = self.sm.add_agent(agent_nm, agent_id, ip, es)</p>
<p>if self.sm.round == 0:</p>
<p>await self._initialize_fl(msg)</p>
<p>await self._send_updated_global_model( \</p>
<p>websocket, id, es)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this example code, the received message from an agent, defined
    here as msg, is decoded by the receive function imported from
    the communication_handler code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular, the self.sm.add_agent(agent_name, agent_id, addr,
    es) function takes the agent name, agent ID, agent IP address, and
    the exch_socket number included in the msg message in order to
    accept the messages from this agent, even if the agent is
    temporarily disconnected and then connected again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After that, the registration function checks whether it should move
    on to the process of initial models or not, depending on the FL
    round that is tracked with self.sm.round. If the FL process is not
    happening yet, that is, if self.sm.round is 0, it calls
    the _initialize_fl(msg) function in order to initialize the FL
    process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, the FL server sends the updated global model back to the agent
    by calling the _send_updated_global_model(websocket, id,
    es) function. The function takes the WebSocket, agent ID,
    and exch_socket as parameters and creates a reply message to the
    agent to notify it whether the participation message has been
    accepted or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The registration process of agents with the FL server is simplified
    in this example code here. In a production environment, all the
    system information from the agent will be pushed to the database so
    that an agent that loses the connection to the FL server can be
    recovered anytime by reconnecting to the FL server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually, if the FL server is installed in the cloud and agents are
    connected to the FL server from their local environment, this
    push-back mechanism from the aggregator to agents will not work
    because of security settings such as firewalls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do not discuss the topic of security issues in detail, so you are
    encouraged to use the polling method implemented in
    the simple-fl code to communicate between the cloud-based aggregator
    and local agents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting socket information to push the global model back to agents</p>
<ul>
<li>The following function called _get_exch_socket takes
    a participation message from the agent and decides which port to use
    to reach out to the agent depending on the simulation flag in the
    message:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def _get_exch_socket(self, msg):</p>
<p>if msg[int(ParticipateMSGLocation.sim_flag)]:</p>
<p>es = msg[int(ParticipateMSGLocation.exch_socket)]</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>es = self.exch_socket</p>
<p>return es</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We support a simulation run in this implementation exercise by which
    you can run all the FL system components of a database, aggregator,
    and multiple agents in one machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initializing the FL process if necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The asynchronous _initialize_fl function is for initializing an FL
    process that is only called when the round of FL is 0. The following
    is the code to do so:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>async def _initialize_fl(self, msg):</p>
<p>agent_id = msg[int(ParticipateMSGLocation.agent_id)]</p>
<p>model_id = msg[int(ParticipateMSGLocation.model_id)]</p>
<p>gene_time = msg[int(ParticipateMSGLocation.gene_time)]</p>
<p>lmodels = msg[int(ParticipateMSGLocation.lmodels)]</p>
<p>perf_val = msg[int(ParticipateMSGLocation.meta_data)]</p>
<p>init_flag = \</p>
<p>bool(msg[int(ParticipateMSGLocation.init_flag)])</p>
<p>self.sm.initialize_model_info(lmodels, init_flag)</p>
<p>await self._push_local_models( \</p>
<p>agent_id, model_id, lmodels, gene_time, perf_val)</p>
<p>self.sm.increment_round()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After extracting the agent ID (agent_id), the model ID (model_id),
    local models from an agent (lmodels), the generated time of the
    model (gene_time), the performance data (perf_val), and the value
    of init_flag from the received message,
    the initialize_model_info function of the state manager code is
    called, which is explained in a later section of This section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This function then pushes the local model to the database by calling
    the _push_local_models function, which is also described in this
    section. You can refer to the <em>Functions to push the local and
    global models to the database</em> section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After that, the round is incremented to proceed to the first round
    in FL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Confirming agent participation with an updated global model</p>
<ul>
<li>After initializing the (cluster) global model, the global models
    need to be sent to the agent connected to the aggregator through
    this registration process. The
    asynchronous _send_updated_global_model function as follows handles
    the process of sending the global models to the agent by taking the
    WebSocket information, agent ID, and the port to use to reach out to
    the agent as parameters. The following code block describes the
    procedure:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>async def _send_updated_global_model( \</p>
<p>self, websocket, agent_id, exch_socket):</p>
<p>model_id = self.sm.cluster_model_ids[-1]</p>
<p>cluster_models = \</p>
<p>convert_LDict_to_Dict(self.sm.cluster_models)</p>

<p>self.sm.id, model_id, cluster_models, self.sm.round,</p>
<p>agent_id, exch_socket, self.recv_socket)</p>
<p>await send_websocket(reply, websocket)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the FL process has already started, that is, the self.sm.round is
    more than 0 already, we get the cluster models from their buffer and
    convert them into a dictionary format with
    the convert_LDict_to_Dict library function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, the reply message is packaged using
    the generate_ agent_participation_confirm_message function and sent
    to the agent that just connected or reconnected to the aggregator by
    calling the send_websocket(reply, websocket) function. Please also
    refer to the <em>Functions to send the global models to the
    agents</em> section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we understand the agents' registration process, let's move
    on to the implementation of handling the local ML models and polling
    messages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The server for handling messages from local agents</p>
<ul>
<li>The asynchronous receive_msg_from_agent process at the FL server is
    constantly running to receive local model updates and to push them
    to the database and the memory buffer temporally saving local
    models. It also responds to the polling messages from the local
    agents. The following code explains this functionality:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>async def receive_msg_from_agent(self, websocket, path):</p>
<p>msg = await receive(websocket)</p>
<p>if msg[int(ModelUpMSGLocation.msg_type)] == \</p>
<p>AgentMsgType.update:</p>
<p>await self._process_lmodel_upload(msg)</p>
<p>elif msg[int(PollingMSGLocation.msg_type)] == \</p>
<p>AgentMsgType.polling:</p>
<p>await self._process_polling(msg, websocket)  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We will then look into the two functions called by
    the receive_msg_from_agent function as shown in the preceding code
    blocks, which are
    the _process_lmodel_upload and _process_polling functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Processing a model upload by local agents</p>
<ul>
<li>The asynchronous _process_lmodel_upload function deals with
    the AgentMsgType.update message. The following code block is about
    the function related to receiving the local ML models and putting
    them into the buffer in the state manager:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>async def _process_lmodel_upload(self, msg):</p>
<p>lmodels = msg[int(ModelUpMSGLocation.lmodels)]</p>
<p>agent_id = msg[int(ModelUpMSGLocation.agent_id)]</p>
<p>model_id = msg[int(ModelUpMSGLocation.model_id)]</p>
<p>gene_time = msg[int(ModelUpMSGLocation.gene_time)]</p>
<p>perf_val = msg[int(ModelUpMSGLocation.meta_data)]</p>
<p>await self._push_local_models( \</p>
<p>agent_id, model_id, lmodels, gene_time, perf_val)</p>
<p>self.sm.buffer_local_models( \</p>
<p>lmodels, participate=False, meta_data=perf_val)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, it extracts the agent ID (agent_id), the model ID (model_id),
    local models from an agent (lmodels), the generated time of the
    model (gene_time), and the performance data (perf_val) from the
    received message, and then calls the _push_local_models function to
    push the local models to the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The buffer_local_models function is then called to save the local
    models (lmodels) in the memory buffer.
    The buffer_local_models function is described in the <em>Maintaining
    models for aggregation with the state manager</em> section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Processing polling by agents</p>
<ul>
<li>The following asynchronous _process_polling function deals with
    the AgentMsgType.polling message:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>async def _process_polling(self, msg, websocket):</p>
<p>if self.sm.round &gt; \</p>
<p>int(msg[int(PollingMSGLocation.round)]):</p>
<p>model_id = self.sm.cluster_model_ids[-1]</p>
<p>cluster_models = \</p>
<p>convert_LDict_to_Dict(self.sm.cluster_models)</p>
<p>msg = generate_cluster_model_dist_message( \</p>
<p>self.sm.id, model_id, self.sm.round, \</p>
<p>cluster_models)</p>
<p>await send_websocket(msg, websocket)</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>msg = generate_ack_message()</p>
<p>await send_websocket(msg, websocket)  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the FL round (self.sm.round) is greater than the local FL round
    included in the received message that is maintained by the local
    agent itself, it means that the model aggregation is done during the
    period between the time when the agent polled to the aggregator last
    time and now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this case, cluster_models that are converted into a dictionary
    format are packaged into a response message
    by generate_cluster_model_dist_message and sent back to the agent
    via the send_websocket function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, the aggregator just returns the <em>ACK</em> message to the
    agent, generated by the generate_ack_message function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we are ready to aggregate the local models received from the
    agents, so let us look into the model aggregation routine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The global model synthesis routine</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The global model synthesis routine process designed in async def
    model_synthesis_routine(self) in the FL server periodically checks
    the number of stored models and executes global model synthesis if
    there are enough local models collected to meet the aggregation
    threshold.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following code describes the model synthesis routine process
    that periodically checks the aggregation criteria and executes model
    synthesis:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>async def model_synthesis_routine(self):</p>
<p>while True:</p>
<p>await asyncio.sleep(self.round_interval)</p>
<p>if self.sm.ready_for_local_aggregation():  </p>
<p>self.agg.aggregate_local_models()</p>
<p>await self._push_cluster_models()</p>
<p>if self.is_polling == False:</p>
<p>await self._send_cluster_models_to_all()</p>
<p>self.sm.increment_round()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This process is asynchronous, running with a while loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular, once the criteria set
    by ready_for_local_aggregation (explained in the <em>Maintaining models
    for aggregation with the state manager</em> section) are met,
    the aggregate_local_models function imported from
    the aggregator.py file is called, where this function averages the
    weights of the collected local models based on FedAvg. Further
    explanation of the aggregate_local_models function can be found in
    the <em>Aggregating local models</em> section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, await self._push_cluster_models() is called to push the
    aggregated cluster global model to the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>await self._send_cluster_models_to_all() is for sending the updated
    global model to all the agents connected to the aggregator if
    the polling method is not used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last but not least, the FL round is incremented
    by self.sm.increment_round().</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the cluster global model is generated, the models need to be
    sent to the connected agents with the functions described in the
    following section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Functions to send the global models to the agents</p>
<ul>
<li>The functionality of sending global models to the connected agents
    is dealt with by the _send_cluster_models_to_all function. This is
    an asynchronous function to send out cluster global models to all
    agents under this aggregator as follows:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>async def _send_cluster_models_to_all(self):</p>
<p>model_id = self.sm.cluster_model_ids[-1]</p>
<p>cluster_models = \</p>
<p>convert_LDict_to_Dict(self.sm.cluster_models)</p>
<p>msg = generate_cluster_model_dist_message( \</p>
<p>self.sm.id, model_id, self.sm.round, \</p>
<p>cluster_models)</p>
<p>for agent in self.sm.agent_set:</p>
<p>await send(msg, agent[\'agent_ip\'], agent[\'socket\'])</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After getting the cluster models' information, it creates the
    message including the cluster models, round, model ID, and
    aggregator ID information using
    the generate_cluster_model_dist_message function and calls
    the send function from the communication_handler libraries to send
    the global models to all the agents in the agent_set registered
    through the agent participation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sending the cluster global models to the connected agents has now
    been explained. Next, we explain how to push the local and cluster
    models to the database.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Functions to push the local and global models to the database</p>
<ul>
<li>The _push_local_models and _push_cluster_models functions are both
    called internally to push and send the local models and cluster
    global models to the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pushing local models to the database</p>
<ul>
<li>Here is the _push_local_models function for pushing a given set of
    local models to the database:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>async def _push_local_models(self, agent_id: str, \</p>
<p>model_id: str, local_models: Dict[str, np.array], \</p>
<p>gene_time: float, performance: Dict[str, float]) \</p>
<p>-&gt; List[Any]:</p>
<p>return await self._push_models(</p>
<p>agent_id, ModelType.local, local_models, \</p>
<p>model_id, gene_time, performance)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The _push_local_models function takes parameters such as the agent
    ID, local models, the model ID, the generated time of the model, and
    the performance data, and returns a response message if there is
    one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pushing cluster models to the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following _push_cluster_models function is for pushing the
    cluster global models to the database:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>async def _push_cluster_models(self) -&gt; List[Any]:</p>
<p>model_id = self.sm.cluster_model_ids[-1]</p>
<p>models = convert_LDict_to_Dict(self.sm.cluster_models)</p>
<p>meta_dict = dict({ \</p>
<p>\"num_samples\" : self.sm.own_cluster_num_samples})</p>
<p>return await self._push_models( \</p>
<p>self.sm.id, ModelType.cluster, models, model_id, \</p>
<p>time.time(), meta_dict)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>_push_cluster_models in this code does not take any parameters, as
    those parameters can be obtained from the instance information and
    buffered memory data of the state manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, self.sm.cluster_model_ids[-1] obtains the ID of the
    latest cluster model, and self.sm.cluster_models stores the latest
    cluster model itself, which is converted into models with a
    dictionary format to be sent to the database. It also
    creates mata_dict to store the number of samples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pushing ML models to the database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both the preceding functions call the _push_models function as
    follows:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>async def _push_models(</p>
<p>self, component_id: str, model_type: ModelType,</p>
<p>models: Dict[str, np.array], model_id: str,</p>
<p>gene_time: float, performance_dict: Dict[str, float])</p>
<p>-&gt; List[Any]:</p>
<p>msg = generate_db_push_message(component_id, \</p>
<p>self.sm.round, model_type, models, model_id, \</p>
<p>gene_time, performance_dict)</p>
<p>resp = await send(msg, self.db_ip, self.db_socket)</p>
<p>return resp</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this code example, the _push_models function takes parameters
    such as component_id (the ID of the aggregator or
    agent), model_type, such as local or cluster
    model, models themselves, model_id, gene_time (the time the model is
    created), and performance_dict as the performance metrics of the
    models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, the message to be sent to the database (using
    the send function) is created by
    the generate_db_push_message function, taking these parameters
    together with the FL round information. It returns a response
    message from the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we have explained all the core functionalities related to
    the FL server, let us look into the role of the state manager, which
    maintains all the models needed for the aggregation process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Maintaining models for aggregation with the  state manager</p>
<ul>
<li>In this section, we will explain state_manager.py, which handles
    maintaining the models and necessary volatile information related to
    the aggregation of local models.</li>
</ul>
<p>State Manager Library Imports</p>
<ul>
<li>This code imports the following. The internal libraries
    for data_struc, helpers, and states are introduced in
    the <em>Appendix</em>, <em>Exploring Internal Libraries</em>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>import numpy as np</p>
<p>import logging</p>
<p>import time</p>
<p>from typing import Dict, Any</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.data_struc import LimitedDict</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.helpers import generate_id, generate_model_id</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.states import IDPrefix</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>After importing the necessary libraries, let's define the state
    manager class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining the state manager class</p>
<ul>
<li>The state manager class (Class StateManager), as seen
    in state_manager.py, is defined in the following code:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>class StateManager:</p>
<p>\"\"\"</p>
<p>StateManager instance keeps the state of an aggregator.</p>
<p>Functions are listed with this indentation.</p>
<p>\"\"\"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This keeps track of the state information of an aggregator. The
    volatile state of an aggregator and agents should also be stored,
    such as local models, agents' info connected to the aggregator,
    cluster models generated by the aggregation process, and the current
    round number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After defining the state manager, let us move on to initializing the
    state manager.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Initializing the state manager</p>
<ul>
<li>In the __init__ constructor, the information related to the FL
    process is configured. The following code is an example of how to
    construct the state manager:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def __init__(self):</p>
<p>self.id = generate_id()</p>
<p>self.agent_set = list()</p>
<p>self.mnames = list()</p>
<p>self.round = 0</p>
<p>self.local_model_buffers = LimitedDict(self.mnames)</p>
<p>self.local_model_num_samples = list()</p>
<p>self.cluster_models = LimitedDict(self.mnames)</p>
<p>self.cluster_model_ids = list()</p>
<p>self.initialized = False</p>
<p>self.agg_threshold = 1.0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ID of the self.id aggregator can be generated randomly using
    the generate_id() function from the util.helpers library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self.agent_set is a set of agents connected to the aggregator where
    the format of the set is a collection of dictionary information,
    related to agents in this case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self.mnames stores the names of each layer of the ML models to be
    aggregated in a list format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self.round is initialized to be 0 so that the round of FL is
    initialized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>local_model_buffers is a list of local models collected by agents
    stored in the memory space. local_model_buffers accepts the local
    models sent from the agents for each FL round, and once the round is
    completed by the aggregation process, this buffer is cleared and
    starts accepting the next round's local models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self.local_model_num_samples is a list that stores the number of
    data samples for the models that are collected in the buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self.cluster_models is a collection of global cluster models in
    the LimitedDict format, and self.cluster_model_ids is a list of IDs
    of cluster models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self.initialized becomes True once the initial global model is set
    and is False otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self.agg_threshold is initialized to be 1.0, which is overwritten by
    the value specified in the config_aggregator.json file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After initializing the state manager, let us investigate
    initializing a global model next.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Initializing a global model</p>
<ul>
<li>The following initialize_model_info function sets up the initial
    global model to be used by the other agents:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def initialize_model_info(self, lmodels, \</p>
<p>init_weights_flag):</p>
<p>for key in lmodels.keys():</p>
<p>self.mnames.append(key)</p>

<p>self.cluster_models = LimitedDict(self.mnames)</p>
<p>self.clear_lmodel_buffers()</p>
<p>if init_weights_flag:</p>
<p>self.initialize_models(lmodels, \</p>
<p>weight_keep=init_weights_flag)</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>self.initialize_models(lmodels, weight_keep=False)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It fills up the model names (self.mnames) extracted from the local
    models (lmodels) sent from an initial agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Together with the model
    names, local_model_buffers and cluster_models are re-initialized
    too. After clearing the local model buffers, it calls
    the initialize_models function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following initialize_models function initializes the structure
    of neural networks (numpy.array) based on the initial base models
    received as parameters of models with a dictionary format
    (str or np.array):</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def initialize_models(self, models: Dict[str, np.array], \</p>
<p>weight_keep: bool = False):</p>
<p>self.clear_saved_models()</p>
<p>for mname in self.mnames:</p>
<p>if weight_keep:</p>
<p>m = models[mname]</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>m = np.zeros_like(models[mname])</p>
<p>self.cluster_models[mname].append(m)</p>
<p>id = generate_model_id(IDPrefix.aggregator, \</p>
<p>self.id, time.time())</p>
<p>self.cluster_model_ids.append(id)</p>
<p>self.initialized = True</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For each layer of the model, defined here as model names, this
    function fills out the model parameters. Depending on
    the weight_keep flag, the model is initialized with zeros or
    parameters that are received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This way, the initial cluster global model is constructed together
    with the randomized model ID. If an agent sends a different ML model
    than the model architecture defined here, the aggregator rejects the
    acceptance of the model or gives an error message to the agent.
    Nothing is returned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, we have covered initializing the global model. In the following
    section, we will explain the core part of the FL process, which is
    checking aggregation criteria.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Checking the aggregation criteria</p>
<ul>
<li>The following code, called ready_for_local_aggregation, is
    for checking the aggregation criteria:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def ready_for_local_aggregation(self) -&gt; bool:</p>
<p>if len(self.mnames) == 0:</p>
<p>return False</p>
<p>num_agents = int(self.agg_threshold * \</p>

<p>else:</p>
<p>return False            </p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This ready_for_local_aggregation function returns a bool value to
    identify whether the aggregator can start the aggregation process.
    It returns True if it satisfies the aggregation criteria (such as
    collecting enough local models to aggregate) and False otherwise.
    The aggregation threshold, agg_threshold, is
    configured in the config_aggregator.json file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following section is about buffering the local models that are
    used for the aggregation process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Buffering the local models</p>
<ul>
<li>The following code on buffer_local_models stores local models from
    an agent in the local model buffer:</li>
</ul>

<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The parameters include the local models formatted as a dictionary as
    well as meta-information such as the number of samples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, this function checks whether the local model sent from an
    agent is either the initial model or not by checking the
    participation flag. If it is an initial model, it calls
    the initialize_model function, as shown in the preceding code block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, for each layer of the model defined with model names, it
    stores the numpy array in the self.local_model_buffers. The key is
    the model name and model mentioned in the preceding code are the
    actual parameters of the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optionally, it can accept the number of samples or data sources that
    the agent has used for the retraining process and push it to
    the self. local_model_num_samples buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This function is called when the FL server receives the local models
    from an agent during the receive_msg_from_agent routine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With that, the local model buffer has been explained. Next, we will
    explain how to clear the saved models so that aggregation can
    continue without having to store unnecessary models in the buffer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearing the saved models</p>
<ul>
<li>The following clear_saved_models function clears all cluster models
    stored in this round:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def clear_saved_models(self):</p>
<p>for mname in self.mnames:</p>
<p>self.cluster_models[mname].clear()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This function is called when initializing the FL process at the very
    beginning and the cluster global model is emptied to start a fresh
    FL round again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following function, the clear_lmodel_buffers function, clears
    all the buffered local models to prepare for the next FL round:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def clear_lmodel_buffers(self):</p>
<p>for mname in self.mnames:</p>
<p>self.local_model_buffers[mname].clear()</p>
<p>self.local_model_num_samples = list()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clearing the local models in local_model_buffers is critical when
    proceeding to the next FL round. Without this process, the models to
    be aggregated are mixed up with the non-relevant models from other
    rounds, and eventually, the performance of the FL is sometimes
    degraded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, we will explain the basic framework of adding agents during
    the FL process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding agents</p>
<ul>
<li>This add_agent function deals with brief agent registration using
    system memory:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def add_agent(self, agent_name: str, agent_id: str, \</p>
<p>agent_ip: str, socket: str):</p>
<p>for agent in self.agent_set:</p>
<p>if agent_name == agent[\'agent_name\']:</p>
<p>return agent[\'agent_id\'], agent[\'socket\']</p>
<p>agent = {</p>
<p>\'agent_name\': agent_name,</p>
<p>\'agent_id\': agent_id,</p>
<p>\'agent_ip\': agent_ip,</p>
<p>\'socket\': socket</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>self.agent_set.append(agent)</p>
<p>return agent_id, socket</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This function just adds agent-related information to
    the self.agent_set list. The agent information includes the agent
    name, agent ID, agent IP address, and the socket number to reach out
    to the agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The socket number can be used when sending the cluster global model
    to the agent connected to the aggregator and when the push method is
    used for communication between an aggregator and an agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This function is only called during the agent registration process
    and returns the agent ID and the socket number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the agent is already registered, which means there is already an
    agent with the same name in agent_set, it returns the agent ID and
    the socket number of the existing agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, this push communication method from an aggregator to agents
    does not work under certain security circumstances. It is
    recommended to use the polling method that the agents use to
    constantly check whether the aggregator has an updated global model
    or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The agent registration mechanism can be expanded using a database,
    which will give you better management of the distributed systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, we will touch on incrementing the FL round.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Incrementing the FL round</p>
<ul>
<li>The increment_round function just increments the round number
    precisely managed by the state manager:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def increment_round(self):</p>
<p>self.round += 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Incrementing rounds is a critical part of the FL process for
    supporting the continuous learning operation. This function is only
    called after registering the initial global model or after each
    model aggregation process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we understand how the FL works with the state manager, in
    the following section, we will talk about the model aggregation
    framework.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Aggregating local models</p>
<ul>
<li>The aggregation.py code handles aggregating local models with a
    bunch of aggregation algorithms. In the code example, we only
    support <strong>FedAvg</strong>, as discussed in the following sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importing the libraries for the aggregator</p>
<ul>
<li>The aggregation.py code imports the following:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>import logging</p>
<p>import time</p>
<p>import numpy as np</p>
<p>from typing import List</p>
<p>from .state_manager import StateManager</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.helpers import generate_model_id</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.states import IDPrefix</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The imported state manager's role and functionalities are discussed
    in the <em>Maintaining models for aggregation with the state
    manager</em> section, and the helpers and states libraries are
    introduced in the <em>Appendix</em>, <em>Exploring Internal Libraries.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>- After importing the necessary libraries, let's define the aggregator
class.</p>
<p>Defining and initializing the aggregator class</p>
<ul>
<li>The following code for class Aggregator defines the core process of
    the aggregator, which provides a set of mathematical functions for
    computing the aggregated models:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>class Aggregator:</p>
<p>\"\"\"</p>
<p>Aggregator class instance provides a set of</p>
<p>mathematical functions to compute aggregated models.</p>
<p>\"\"\"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The following __init__ function just sets up the state manager
    of the aggregator to access the model buffers:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def __init__(self, sm: StateManager):</p>
<p>self.sm = sm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the aggregator class is defined and initialized, let's look at
    the actual FedAvg algorithm implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining the aggregate_local_models function</p>
<ul>
<li>The following aggregate_local_models function is the code for
    aggregating the local models:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def aggregate_local_models(self):</p>
<p>for mname in self.sm.mnames:</p>
<p>self.sm.cluster_models[mname][0] \</p>
<p>= self._average_aggregate( \</p>
<p>self.sm.local_model_buffers[mname], \</p>
<p>self.sm.local_model_num_samples)</p>
<p>self.sm.own_cluster_num_samples = \</p>
<p>sum(self.sm.local_model_num_samples)</p>
<p>id = generate_model_id( \</p>
<p>IDPrefix.aggregator, self.sm.id, time.time())</p>
<p>self.sm.cluster_model_ids.append(id)</p>
<p>self.sm.clear_lmodel_buffers()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This function can be called after the aggregation criteria are
    satisfied, such as the aggregation threshold defined in
    the config_aggregator.json file. The aggregation process uses local
    ML models buffered in the memory of the state manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those local ML models are sent from the registered agents. For each
    layer of the models defined by mname, the weights of the model are
    averaged by the _average_aggregate function as follows to realize
    FedAvg. After averaging the model parameters of all the
    layers, cluster_models is updated, which is sent to all the agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, the local model buffer is cleared to be ready for the next
    round of the FL process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The FedAvg function</p>
<ul>
<li>The following function, _average_aggregate, called by the
    preceding aggregate_local_models function, is the code that realizes
    the FedAvg aggregation method:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def _average_aggregate(self, buffer: List[np.array],</p>
<p>num_samples: List[int]) -&gt; np.array:</p>
<p>denominator = sum(num_samples)</p>
<p>model = float(num_samples[0])/denominator * buffer[0]</p>
<p>for i in range(1, len(buffer)):</p>
<p>model += float(num_samples[i]) /</p>
<p>denominator * buffer[i]</p>
<p>return model</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the _average_aggregate function, the computation is simple
    enough that, for each buffer of the given list of ML models, it
    takes averaged parameters for the models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The basics of model aggregation are discussed earlier. It returns
    the weighted aggregated models with np.array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we have covered all the essential functionalities of the FL
    server and aggregator, next, we will talk about how to run the FL
    server itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Running the FL server</p>
<ul>
<li>Here is an example of running the FL server. In order to run the FL
    server, you will just execute the following code:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>if __name__ == \"__main__\":</p>
<p>s = Server()</p>
<p>init_fl_server(s.register,</p>
<p>s.receive_msg_from_agent,</p>
<p>s.model_synthesis_routine(),</p>
<p>s.aggr_ip, s.reg_socket, s.recv_socket)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The register, receive_msg_from_agnet,
    and model_synthesis_routine functions of the instance of the FL
    server are for starting the registration process of the agents,
    receiving messages from the agents, and starting the model synthesis
    process to create a global model, which are all started using
    the init_fl_server function from
    the communication_handler libraries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have covered all the core modules of the aggregator with the FL
    server. They can work with the database server, which will be
    discussed in the following section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing and running the database server</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The database server can be hosted either on the same machine as the
    aggregator server or separately from the aggregator server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the database server is hosted on the same machine or not,
    the code introduced here is still applicable to both cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The database-related code is found in the fl_main/pseudodb folder of
    the GitHub repository provided alongside this book.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuring the database</p>
<ul>
<li>The following code is an example of the database-side configuration
    parameters saved as config_db.json:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>{</p>
<p>\"db_ip\": \"localhost\",</p>
<p>\"db_socket\": \"9017\",</p>
<p>\"db_name\": \"sample_data\",</p>
<p>\"db_data_path\": \"./db\",</p>
<p>\"db_model_path\": \"./db/models\"</p>
<p>}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In particular, db_data_path is the location of the SQLite database
    and db_model_path is the location of the ML model binary files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The config_db.json file can be found in the setup folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, let's define the database server and import the necessary
    libraries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining the database server</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The main functionality of the pseudo_db.py code is accepting
    messages that contain local and cluster global models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Importing the libraries for the pseudo database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, the pseudo_db.py code imports the following:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>import pickle, logging, time, os</p>
<p>from typing import Any, List</p>
<p>from .sqlite_db import SQLiteDBHandler</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.helpers import generate_id, read_config,
set_config_file</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.states import DBMsgType, DBPushMsgLocation,
ModelType</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.communication_handler import init_db_server,
send_websocket, receive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>It imports the basic general libraries as well
    as SQLiteDBHandler (discussed later in the <em>Defining the database
    with SQLite </em>section) and the functions from the lib/util libraries
    that are discussed in the <em>Appendix</em>, <em>Exploring Internal
    Libraries</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining the PseudoDB class</p>
<ul>
<li>The PseudoDB class is then defined to create an instance that
    receives models and their data from an aggregator and pushes them to
    an actual database (SQLite, in this case):</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>class PseudoDB:</p>
<p>\"\"\"</p>
<p>PseudoDB class instance receives models and their data</p>
<p>from an aggregator, and pushes them to database</p>
<p>\"\"\"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Now, let us move on to initializing the instance of PseudoDB.</li>
</ul>
<p>Initializing PseudoDB</p>
<ul>
<li>Then, the initialization process, __init__, is defined as
    follows:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def __init__(self):</p>
<p>self.id = generate_id()</p>
<p>self.config = read_config(set_config_file(\"db\"))</p>
<p>self.db_ip = self.config[\'db_ip\']</p>
<p>self.db_socket = self.config[\'db_socket\']</p>
<p>self.data_path = self.config[\'db_data_path\']</p>
<p>if not os.path.exists(self.data_path):</p>
<p>os.makedirs(self.data_path)</p>
<p>self.db_file = \</p>
<p>f\'{self.data_path}/model_data{time.time()}.db\'</p>
<p>self.dbhandler = SQLiteDBHandler(self.db_file)</p>
<p>self.dbhandler.initialize_DB()</p>
<p>self.db_model_path = self.config[\'db_model_path\']</p>
<p>if not os.path.exists(self.db_model_path):</p>
<p>os.makedirs(self.db_model_path)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The initialization process generates the ID of the instance and sets
    up various parameters such as the database socket (db_socket), the
    database IP address (db_ip), the path to the database (data_path),
    and the database file (db_file), all configured from config_db.json.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dbhandler stores the instance of SQLiteDBHandler and calls
    the initialize_DB function to create an SQLite database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Folders for data_path and db_model_path are created if they do not
    already exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the initialization process of PseudoDB, we need to design the
    communication module that accepts the messages from the aggregators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We again use WebSocket for communicating with an aggregator and
    start this module as a server to accept and respond to messages from
    an aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this design, we do not push messages from the database server to
    an aggregator or agents in order to make the FL mechanism simpler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handling messages from the aggregator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following code for the async def handler function,
    which takes websocket as a parameter, receives messages from the
    aggregator and returns the requested information:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>async def handler(self, websocket, path):</p>
<p>msg = await receive(websocket)</p>
<p>msg_type = msg[DBPushMsgLocation.msg_type]</p>
<p>reply = list()</p>
<p>if msg_type == DBMsgType.push:</p>
<p>self._push_all_data_to_db(msg)</p>
<p>reply.append(\'confirmation\')</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>raise TypeError(f\'Undefined DB Message Type: \</p>
<p>{msg_type}.\')</p>
<p>await send_websocket(reply, websocket)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the handler function, once it decodes the received message from
    an aggregator, the handler function checks whether the message type
    is push or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If so, it tries to push the local or cluster models to the database
    by calling the _push_all_data_to_db function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, it will show an error message. The confirmation message
    about pushing the models to the database can then be sent back to
    the aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, we only defined the type of the push message, but you can
    define as many types as possible, together with the enhancement of
    the database schema and design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pushing all the data to the database</p>
<ul>
<li>The following code for _push_all_data_to_db pushes the models'
    information to the database:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def _push_all_data_to_db(self, msg: List[Any]):</p>
<p>pm = self._parse_message(msg)</p>
<p>self.dbhandler.insert_an_entry(*pm)</p>
<p>model_id = msg[int(DBPushMsgLocation.model_id)]</p>
<p>models = msg[int(DBPushMsgLocation.models)]</p>
<p>fname = f\'{self.db_model_path}/{model_id}.binaryfile\'</p>
<p>with open(fname, \'wb\') as f:</p>
<p>pickle.dump(models, f)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The models' information is extracted by the _parse_message function
    and passed to the _insert_an_entry function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, the actual models are saved in the local server filesystems,
    where the filename of the models and the path are defined
    by db_model_path and fname here.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Parsing the message</p>
<ul>
<li>The _parse_message function just extracts the parameters from the
    received message:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def _parse_message(self, msg: List[Any]):</p>
<p>component_id = msg[int(DBPushMsgLocation.component_id)]</p>
<p>r = msg[int(DBPushMsgLocation.round)]</p>
<p>mt = msg[int(DBPushMsgLocation.model_type)]</p>
<p>model_id = msg[int(DBPushMsgLocation.model_id)]</p>

<p>try: local_prfmc = meta_data[\"accuracy\"]</p>
<p>except: pass</p>
<p>num_samples = 0</p>
<p>try: num_samples = meta_data[\"num_samples\"]</p>
<p>except: pass</p>
<p>return component_id, r, mt, model_id, gene_time, \</p>
<p>local_prfmc, num_samples</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This function parses the received message into parameters related to
    agent ID or aggregator ID (component_id), round number (r), message
    type (mt), model_id, time of generation of the models (gene_time),
    and performance data as a dictionary format (meta_data).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local performance data, local_prfmc, is extracted when the model
    type is local. The amount of sample data used at the local device is
    also extracted from meta_dect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All these extracted parameters are returned at the end.</p>

    follow the uploaded local models and their performance as well as
    the global models created by an aggregator.</p>
</li>

<p>The local_models table has a model ID (model_id), the time the model
    is generated (generation_time), an agent ID uploaded of the local

    the local model (performance), and the number of samples used for
    FedAvg aggregation (num_samples).</p>

<p>component_id, r, num_samples))</p>
<p>conn.commit()</p>
<p>conn.close()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This function takes the parameters of component_id (agent ID or
    aggregator ID), round number (r), message type (mt), model ID
    (model_id), the time the model is generated (gtime), the local
    model's performance data (local_prfmc), and the number of samples
    (num_samples) to insert an entry with the execute function of the
    SQLite library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the model type is <em>local</em>, the information of the models is
    inserted into the local_models table. If the model type
    is <em>cluster</em>, the information of the models is inserted into
    the cluster_models table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other functions, such as updating and deleting data from the
    database, are not implemented in this example code and it's up to
    you to write those additional functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the following section, we will explain how to run the database
    server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Running the database server</p>
<ul>
<li>Here is the code for running the database server with the SQLite
    database:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>if __name__ == \"__main__\":</p>
<p>pdb = PseudoDB()</p>
<p>init_db_server(pdb.handler, pdb.db_ip, pdb.db_socket)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The instance of PseudoDB class is created as pdb. The pdb.handler,
    the database's IP address (pdb.db_ip), and the database socket
    (pdb.db_socket) are used to start the process of receiving local and
    cluster models from an aggregator enabled by init_db_server from
    the communication_handler library in the util/lib folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, we understand how to implement and run the database server. The
    database tables and schema discussed here are minimally designed so
    that we can understand the fundamentals of the FL server's
    procedure. In the following section, we will discuss potential
    enhancements to the FL server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FL Server Potential enhancements</p>
<ul>
<li>Here are some of the key potential enhancements to the FL server
    discussed Here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Redesigning the database</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The database was intentionally designed with minimal table
    information in this book and needs to be extended, such as by having
    tables of the aggregator itself, agents, the initial base model, and
    the project info, among other things, in the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, the FL system described here does not support the
    termination and restart of the server and agent processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, the FL server implementation is not complete, as it loses most
    of the information when any of the systems is stopped or failed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Automating the registry of an initial model</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to simplify the explanation of the process of registering
    the initial model, we defined the layers of the ML models using
    model names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This registration of the model in the system can be automated so
    that just loading a certain ML model, such as PyTorch or Keras
    models, with file extensions such as .pt/.pth and .h5, will be
    enough for the users of the FL systems to start the process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Performance metrics for local and global models</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Again, to simplify the explanation of the FL server and the
    database-side functionalities, an accuracy value is just used as one
    of the performance criteria of the models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually, ML applications have many more metrics to keep track of as
    performance data and they need to be enhanced together with the
    database and communications protocol design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fine-tuned aggregation</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to simplify the process of aggregating the local models, we
    just used FedAvg, a weighted averaging method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of samples can dynamically change depending on the local
    environment, and that aspect is enhanced by you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are also a variety of model aggregation methods, which will be
    explained later, <em>Model Aggregation</em>, of this work so that you can
    accommodate the best aggregation method depending on the ML
    applications to be created and integrated into the FL system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here, the basics and principles of FL server-side implementation
    were explained with actual code examples. Having followed the
    contents of This section, you should now be able to construct the FL
    server-side functionalities with model aggregation mechanisms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server-side components that were introduced here involve basic
    communications and the registration of the agents and initial
    models, managing state information used for the aggregation, and the
    aggregation mechanisms for creating the global cluster models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, we discussed the implementation of the database to just
    store the information of the ML models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code was simplified so that you were able to understand the
    principles of server-side functionalities. Further enhancements to
    many other aspects of constructing a more sustainable, resilient,
    and scalable FL system are up to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next section, we will discuss the principle of implementing
    the functionalities of the FL client and agent. The client side
    needs to provide some well-designed APIs for the ML applications for
    plugin use. Therefore, the section will discuss the FL client\'s
    core functionalities and libraries as well as the library
    integration into the very simple ML applications to enable the whole
    FL process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>[Section 5: FL Client Side Implementation]{.underline}</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The client-side modules of a <strong>federated learning</strong> (<strong>FL</strong>) system
    can be implemented based on the system architecture, sequence, and
    procedure flow, as discussed earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL client-side functionalities can connect distributed <strong>machine
    learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>) applications that conduct local training and
    testing with an aggregator, through a communications module embedded
    in the client-side libraries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the example of using the FL client libraries in a local ML
    engine, the minimal engine package example will be discussed, with
    dummy ML models to understand the process of integration with the FL
    client libraries that are designed Here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By following the example code about integration, you will understand
    how to actually enable the whole process related to the FL client
    side, as discussed earlier, while an analysis on what will happen
    with the minimal example will be discussed in  <em>Running the
    Federated Learning System and Analyzing the Results</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, an overview of the design and implementation principle of FL
    client-side functionalities used in local ML engines will be
    discussed.  you will be able to code the FL client-side modules and
    libraries as well as distributed local ML engines, such as image
    classification with <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks</strong> (<strong>CNNs</strong>).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The architecture of an FL client as an agent was introduced earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, we will introduce code that realizes the basic functionalities
    of an FL client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client side of software architecture is simplified here, where
    only the client.py file can be used in this example, together with
    supporting functions from the lib/util folder, as shown in <em>Figure
    5.1</em>:</p>

<li>The following section gives a brief description of the Python files
    for an agent of the FL system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Distributed agent-side code</p>
<ul>
<li>For the agent side, there is one main file, client.py, in
    the fl_main/agent directory that deals with most of the FL
    client-side functionalities.</li>
</ul>
<p>FL client code (client.py)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The client.py file in the agent folder has functions to participate
    in an FL cycle, an ML model exchange framework with an aggregator,
    and <em>push</em> and <em>polling</em> mechanisms to communicate with the
    aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client's functions can also serve as interfaces between the
    local ML application and the FL system itself, providing FL
    client-side libraries to the ML engine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the main code that connects locally trained ML models to the
    FL server and aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to prepare a local ML application by yourself, and we will
    help you understand how to integrate your ML engine into an FL
    system using the FL client libraries, which is another main topic of
    This section.</p>

</ul>
<p>lib/util code</p>
<ul>
<li>An explanation of the supporting Python code
    (communication_handler.py, data_struc.py, helpers.py, messengers.py,
    and states.py) as internal libraries will be covered in <em>Appendix,
    Exploring Internal Libraries</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuration of an agent</p>
<ul>
<li>The following is an example of client-side configuration parameters
    saved as config_agent.json in the code we are using:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>{</p>
<p>\"aggr_ip\": \"localhost\",</p>
<p>\"reg_socket\": \"8765\",</p>
<p>\"model_path\": \"./data/agents\",</p>
<p>\"local_model_file_name\": \"lms.binaryfile\",</p>
<p>\"global_model_file_name\": \"gms.binaryfile\",</p>
<p>\"state_file_name\": \"state\",</p>
<p>\"init_weights_flag\": 1,</p>
<p>\"polling\": 1</p>
<p>}</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aggregator's IP (aggr_ip) and its port number (reg_socket) are
    used to get connected to the FL server, where the aggregation of the
    local models happens. In addition, the model path
    parameter, model_path, specifies the location of both the local
    model (named local_model_file_name) and the global model
    (named global_model_file_name).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local and global models are stored as binary files
    (lms.binaryfile and gms.binaryfile in this example). The state file
    (named state_file_name) writes the local state of the client that
    defines waiting for the global models, training the models, sending
    the trained models, and so on. init_weights_flag is used when the
    system operator wants to initialize the global model with certain
    weights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the flag is 1, the agent will send the pre-configured model;
    otherwise, the model will be filled with zeros on the aggregator
    side. The polling flag (polling) concerns whether to utilize the
    polling method or not for communication between agents and an
    aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we've discussed FL client-side modules, let's look into the
    actual implementation and some code to realize the functionalities
    of an FL client.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing FL client-side main functionalities</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this section, we will explain how you can implement basic FL
    client-side code, which is described in the client.py file in
    the agent directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By learning about this client-side code, you will understand how to
    implement an agent's registration process, model exchange
    synchronization, and <em>push</em>/<em>polling</em> mechanisms, as well as the
    communication protocol between the agent and aggregator, with some
    functions that will be called from other ML applications
    as <strong>Application Programming Interfaces</strong> (<strong>APIs</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's first see what libraries will be imported for implementing FL
    client functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Importing libraries for an agent</p>
<ul>
<li>In this client.py file example, the agent imports general libraries
    such as asyncio and time (a detailed explanation of which is out of
    scope for this book):</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>import asyncio, time, logging, sys, os</p>
<p>from typing import Dict, Any</p>
<p>from threading import Thread</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.communication_handler import \</p>
<p>init_client_server, send, receive</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.helpers import read_config, \</p>
<p>init_loop, save_model_file, load_model_file, \</p>
<p>read_state, write_state, generate_id, \</p>
<p>set_config_file, get_ip, compatible_data_dict_read, \</p>
<p>generate_model_id, create_data_dict_from_models, \</p>
<p>create_meta_data_dict</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.states import ClientState, \</p>
<p>AggMsgType, ParticipateConfirmationMSGLocation, \</p>
<p>GMDistributionMsgLocation, IDPrefix</p>
<p>from fl_main.lib.util.messengers import \</p>
<p>generate_lmodel_update_message, \</p>
<p>generate_agent_participation_message, \</p>
<p>generate_polling_message</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As for the communication_handler, helpers, states,
    and messengers libraries imported from fl_main.lib.util that are
    designed for enabling the FL general functionalities, please refer
    to the <em>Appendix, Exploring Internal Libraries</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After importing the necessary libraries, you will define
    the Client class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining the Client class</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's define the Client class that implements the core
    functionalities of an FL client, including the participation
    mechanism of the agent itself, the model exchange framework, and a
    communication interface between the agent and an aggregator, as well
    as libraries provided for use in the agent-side local ML engine:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>class Client:</p>
<p>\"\"\"</p>
<p>Client class instance with FL client-side functions</p>
<p>and libraries used in the agent\'s ML engine</p>
<p>\"\"\"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Then, you will initialize the Client class under
    the __init__ function, as discussed in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Initializing the client</p>
<ul>
<li>The following code inside the __init__ constructor is an example
    of the initialization process of the client:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def __init__(self):</p>
<p>self.agent_name = \'default_agent\'</p>
<p>self.id = generate_id()</p>
<p>self.agent_ip = get_ip()</p>
<p>self.simulation_flag = False</p>
<p>if len(sys.argv) &gt; 1:</p>
<p>self.simulation_flag = bool(int(sys.argv[1]))</p>
<p>config_file = set_config_file(\"agent\")</p>
<p>self.config = read_config(config_file)</p>
<p>self.aggr_ip = self.config[\'aggr_ip\']</p>
<p>self.reg_socket = self.config[\'reg_socket\']</p>
<p>self.msend_socket = 0</p>
<p>self.exch_socket = 0</p>
<p>if self.simulation_flag:</p>
<p>self.exch_socket = int(sys.argv[2])</p>
<p>self.agent_name = sys.argv[3]</p>
<p>self.model_path = f\'{self.config[\"model_path\"]}</p>
<p>/{self.agent_name}\'</p>
<p>if not os.path.exists(self.model_path):</p>
<p>os.makedirs(self.model_path)</p>
<p>self.lmfile = self.config[\'local_model_file_name\']</p>
<p>self.gmfile = self.config[\'global_model_file_name\']</p>
<p>self.statefile = self.config[\'state_file_name\']</p>
<p>self.round = 0</p>
<p>self.init_weights_flag = \</p>
<p>bool(self.config[\'init_weights_flag\'])</p>
<p>self.is_polling = bool(self.config[\'polling\'])</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, the client generates a unique ID for itself as an identifier
    that will be used in many scenarios to conduct FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, the client gets its own IP address by using
    the get_ip() function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, simulation runs are supported in this implementation exercise,
    where we can run all the FL system components of a database, server,
    and multiple agents within one machine. If simulation needs to be
    done, then the simulation_flag parameter needs to be True (refer to
    the README file on GitHub for how to set up a simulation mode).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, self.cofig reads and stores the information
    of config_agent.json.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client then configures the aggregator's information to connect
    to its server, where self.aggr_ip reads the IP address of the
    aggregator machine or instance from the agent configuration file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After that, the reg_socket port will be set up, where reg_socket is
    used for registration of the agent, together with an aggregator IP
    address stored as self.aggr_ip. The reg_socket value in this example
    can be read from the agent configuration file as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>msend_socket, which is used in the model exchange routine to send
    the local ML models to the aggregator, will be configured after
    participating in the FL process by sending a message to the FL
    server and receiving the response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exch_socket is used when communication is not in <em>polling</em> mode for
    receiving global models sent from the aggregator, together with an
    agent IP address stored as self.agent_ip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exch_socket in this example can either be read from the arguments
    from the command line or decided by the aggregator, depending on the
    simulation mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this example, when the aggregator is set to be able to push
    messages to the connected agents, which is not the case when polling
    mode is on, exch_socket can be dynamically configured by the
    aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self.model_path stores the path to the local and global models and
    can either be read from the agent configuration file or arguments
    from the command line, depending on the simulation mode as well. If
    there is no directory to save those model files, it makes sure to
    create the directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self.lmfile, self.gmfile, and self.statefile are the filenames for
    local models, global models, and the state of the client
    respectively, and read from the configuration file of the agent. In
    particular, in self.statefile, the value of ClientState is
    saved. ClientState is the enumeration value of the client itself
    where there is a state waiting for the global model (waiting_gm), a
    state for local training (training), a state for sending local
    models (sending), and a state for having the updated global models
    (gm_ready).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The round information of the FL process, defined as self.round, is
    initialized as 0 and later updated as the FL round proceeds with
    model aggregation, where the aggregator will notify the change of
    the round usually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self.init_weights_flag is the flag used when a system operator wants
    to initialize a global model with certain parameters, as explained
    in the configuration of the agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The self.is_polling flag concerns whether to use the polling method
    in communication between the agents and aggregator or not. The
    polling flag must be the same as the one set up on the aggregator
    side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code about the __init__ constructor discussed here can be
    found in client.py in the fl_main/agent folder on GitHub
    (<a href="https://github.com/tie-set/simple-fl">[https://github.com/keshavaspanda/simple-fl]{.underline}</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we have discussed how to initialize a client-side module,
    in the next section, we will look into how the participation
    mechanism works with some sample code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Agent participation in an FL cycle</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This participation or registration process is needed for an agent to
    be able to participate in an FL process together with other agents.
    Therefore, the agent needs to be added to the list of authorized
    agents that can send locally trained ML models to an aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The asynchronous participate function sends the first message to an
    aggregator to join the FL cycle and will receive state and
    communication information, such as socket numbers from the
    aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An agent knows the IP address and port number to join the FL
    platform through the config_agent.json file. When joining the FL
    platform, an agent sends a participation message that contains the
    following information:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-12-1" name="__codelineno-12-1" href="#__codelineno-12-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   agent_name: A unique name of an agent itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>id: A unique identifier of an agent itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>model_id: A unique identifier of models to be sent to an aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>models: A dictionary of models keyed by model names. The weights of
    models need not be trained if init_flag is False, since it is only
    used by an aggregator to remember the shapes of models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>init_weights_flag: A Boolean flag to indicate whether the sent model
    weights should be used as a base model. If it is True and there are
    no global models ready, an aggregator sets this set of local models
    as the first global models and sends it to all agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>simulation_flag: This is True if it is a simulation run; otherwise,
    it is False.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exch_socket: The port number waiting for global models from the
    aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gene_time: The time that models are generated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>performance_dict: Performance data related to models in a dictionary
    format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>agent_ip: The IP address of an agent itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-13-1" name="__codelineno-13-1" href="#__codelineno-13-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   With all the aforementioned participation messages defined, the
    agent is ready to exchange models with the aggregator, and the code
    to realize the participation process is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>async def participate(self):</p>
<p>data_dict, performance_dict = \</p>
<p>load_model_file(self.model_path, self.lmfile)</p>
<p>_, gene_time, models, model_id = \</p>

<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The agent reads the local models to tell the structure of the ML
    models to the aggregator, and the initial model does not necessarily
    need to be trained. data_dict and performance_dict store the models
    and their performance data respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, a message, msg, containing information such as the
    ML models and its model_id, is packaged using
    the generate_agent_participation_message function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When sending the message, in this example, the WebSocket is
    constructed using the aggregator's IP address (aggr_ip) and the
    registration port number (reg_socket) to be connected to the
    aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After sending the message to the aggregator via an
    asynchronous send function imported from communication_handler, the
    agent receives a response message, resp, from the aggregator. The
    response will include the round info, the port number to receive the
    global models' exch_socket, the port number to send the local models
    to the aggregator's msend_socket, and an updated agent ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the global model within the response message is saved
    locally by calling the save_model_from_message function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The participation mechanism of an agent has been explained. In the
    next section, we will learn about the framework of model exchange
    synchronization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Model exchange synchronization</p>
<ul>
<li>Model exchange synchronization, as shown in the following code, is
    for checking the state of the agent and calling a proper function
    based on the state:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Async def model_exchange_routine(self):</p>
<p>while True:</p>
<p>await asyncio.sleep(5)</p>
<p>state = read_state(self.model_path, self.statefile)</p>
<p>if state == ClientState.sending:</p>
<p>await self.send_models()</p>
<p>elif state == ClientState.waiting_gm:</p>
<p>if self.is_polling == True:</p>
<p>await self.process_polling()</p>
<p>else: pass</p>
<p>elif state == ClientState.training: pass</p>
<p>elif state == ClientState.gm_ready: pass</p>
<p>else: pass</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Basically, this process is always running while the client is alive,
    whereas the while loop is used periodically to check the
    client's state and proceed with the next steps if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the while loop, after waiting a few seconds, it first checks the
    client state by the read_state function. The parameters in
    the read_state function are to locate the state file stored in the
    local environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As mentioned, ClientState has the enumeration value of the client
    state itself, defining a state for sending local models (sending), a
    state waiting for the global model (waiting_sgm), a state for local
    training (training), and a state for receiving the updated global
    models (gm_ready).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the client is in the sending state (state ==
    ClientState.sending), it means it is ready to send the locally
    trained model to the aggregator. Therefore, the agent calls
    the send_models function to send the locally trained ML model to the
    aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the state is waiting_gm (state == ClientState.waiting_gm), it
    either proceeds with process_polling to poll from the agent to the
    aggregator if polling mode is on, or just does nothing if polling
    mode is off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the client is in the training state (state ==
    ClientState.training), it means that the client is training the
    local model now and just waits for a few seconds, printing the
    training status if necessary. You can also add any procedure if
    needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the client is in the gm_ready state (state ==
    ClientState.gm_ready), it means that the client received the global
    model. This state will be handled by a local ML application, and it
    does nothing but show the readiness of the global models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next section, we will talk about how
    the <em>push</em> and <em>polling</em> mechanisms can be implemented for an FL
    cycle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Push and polling implementation</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once an agent is initialized and confirmed for participation in an
    FL process, it starts waiting for the global models sent from an
    aggregator. There are two ways to receive global models from the
    aggregator: the push method and the polling method. Although
    the <strong>Secure Sockets Layer</strong> (<strong>SSL</strong>) or <strong>Transport Layer
    Security</strong> (<strong>TSL</strong>) frameworks are not implemented in FL
    client-side code here for simplification, it is recommended to
    support them to secure constant communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's look into the mechanism for each communication framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The push method from aggregator to agent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the push method, the aggregator will push the message that
    includes global models to all the connected agents right after the
    global models are generated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following code shows the <em>push</em> mechanism accepting and saving
    global models from the aggregator:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>async def wait_models(self, websocket, path):</p>
<p>gm_msg = await receive(websocket)</p>
<p>self.save_model_from_message( \</p>
<p>gm_msg, GMDistributionMsgLocation)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The wait_models asynchronous function accepts websocket as a
    parameter. When the aggregator sends a message to the agent, it
    receives the gm_msg message through await recieve(websocket) and
    saves the global models locally by calling
    the save_model_from_message function, as defined in the <em>Toward
    designing FL client libraries</em> section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The polling method from agent to aggregator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the polling method, an agent will keep asking (polling) an
    aggregator to see whether global models are already formed or not.
    Once it has been created and is ready to be sent to the connected
    agents, the polled message will be returned to the agent with the
    updated global models in the response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following code about the process_polling asynchronous function
    illustrates the polling method:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>async def process_polling(self):</p>
<p>msg = generate_polling_message(self.round, self.id)</p>
<p>resp = await send(msg, self.aggr_ip, self.msend_socket)</p>
<p>if resp[int(PollingMSGLocation.msg_type)] \</p>
<p>== AggMsgType.update:</p>
<p>self.save_model_from_message(resp, \</p>
<p>GMDistributionMsgLocation)</p>
<p>else: pass</p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It first generates the polling message with
    the generate_polling_message function to be sent to the aggregator.
    After receiving the response message, resp, from the aggregator, if
    the message type is AggMsgType.update, meaning the response message
    contains the updated global models, it calls
    the save_model_from_message function. Otherwise, it does nothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aforementioned functions are the basic but core features of an
    FL client, and those functions need to be efficiently used by a
    user-side ML application as libraries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that FL client design, including initialization, participation,
    and model exchanges, has been explained, we will learn about how to
    design FL client libraries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Designing FL client libraries</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this section, we will explain how to package essential functions
    to be provided as libraries to users. In this example, the simplest
    way to package them as libraries will be discussed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will need to be expanded, depending on your needs and the
    design of your own FL client framework. By packaging FL client-side
    modules as libraries, developers will be easily able to integrate
    the FL client's functions into the local ML engine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's start with how to define a library to start and register an FL
    client.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting FL client core threads</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For local ML application developers to be able to integrate FL
    client-related functions, they sometimes need to be packaged as
    threading functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following code to register an agent in the FL system simply puts
    a participate function into the run_until_complete function of
    an asyncio.get_event_loop function:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def register_client(self):</p>
<p>asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete( \</p>
<p>self.participate())</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Also, the start_wait_model_server function is packaged, as shown in
    the following code block, where the Thread function takes care of
    the constant run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This way, you will be able to run the local ML module in parallel
    and receive global models in the wait_models thread when the FL
    system is in <em>push</em> communication mode:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def start_wait_model_server(self):</p>
<p>th = Thread(target = init_client_server, \</p>
<p>args=[self.wait_models, self.agent_ip, \</p>
<p>self.exch_socket])</p>
<p>th.start()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, the start_model_exhange_server function can be a thread
    to run a model exchange routine to synchronize the local and global
    models, while the local ML module is running in parallel. You can
    just call the following start_model_exchange_server function as a
    library to enable this functionality:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def start_model_exchange_server(self):</p>
<p>self.agent_running = True</p>
<p>th = Thread(target = init_loop, \</p>
<p>args=[self.model_exchange_routine()])</p>
<p>th.start()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, it may be helpful to package all these three functions to
    execute at the same time when they are called outside
    the Client class. Therefore, we introduce the following code
    concerning start_fl_client that aggregates the functions of
    registering agents, waiting for global models and a model exchange
    routine to start the FL client core functions:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def start_fl_client(self):</p>
<p>self.register_client()</p>
<p>if self.is_polling == False:</p>
<p>self.start_wait_model_server()</p>
<p>self.start_model_exchange_server()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The initiation of the FL client is now packaged
    into start_fl_client. Next, we will define the libraries of saved ML
    models.</li>
</ul>
<p>Saving global models</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While the load and save model functions are provided by the helper
    functions in lib/util, which will be explained later in
    the <em>Appendix</em>, <em>Exploring Internal Libraries</em>, it is helpful to
    provide an interface for ML developers to save global models from a
    message sent from an aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following save_model_from_message function is one that extracts
    and saves global models in an agent and also changes the client
    state to gm_ready. This function takes the message (msg) and message
    location (MSG_LOC) information as parameters:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def save_model_from_message(self, msg, MSG_LOC):</p>
<p>data_dict = create_data_dict_from_models( \</p>
<p>msg[int(MSG_LOC.model_id)],</p>
<p>msg[int(MSG_LOC.global_models)],</p>
<p>msg[int(MSG_LOC.aggregator_id)])</p>
<p>self.round = msg[int(MSG_LOC.round)]</p>
<p>save_model_file(data_dict, self.model_path, \</p>
<p>self.gmfile)</p>
<p>self.tran_state(ClientState.gm_ready)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The global models, model ID, and aggregator ID are extracted from
    the message and put into a dictionary using
    the create_data_dict_from_models library. The round information is
    also updated based on the received message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, the received global models are saved to the local file using
    the save_model_file library, in which the data dictionary, model
    path, and global model file name are specified to save the models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After receiving the global models, it changes the client state
    to gm_ready, the state indicating that the global model is ready for
    the local ML to be utilized by calling the tran_state function,
    which will be explained in the next section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the function of saving global models defined, we are ready to
    move on to how to manipulate the client state in the next section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Manipulating client state</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to manipulate the client state so that it can logically
    handle local and global models, we prepare
    the read_state and tran_state functions, which can be accessed both
    from inside and outside the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following read_state function reads the value written
    in statefile, stored in the location specified by model_path. The
    enumeration value of ClientState is used to change the client state:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def read_state(self) -&gt; ClientState:</p>
<p>return read_state(self.model_path, self.statefile)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The following tran_state function changes the state of the agent. In
    this code sample, the state is maintained in the local state file
    only:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def tran_state(self, state: ClientState):</p>
<p>write_state(self.model_path, self.statefile, state)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, let's define the functions that can send local models to an
    aggregator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sending local models to aggregator</p>
<ul>
<li>The following asynchronous send_models function is about sending
    models that have been saved locally to the aggregator:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>async def send_models(self):</p>
<p>data_dict, performance_dict = \</p>
<p>load_model_file(self.model_path, self.lmfile)</p>
<p>, _, models, model_id = \</p>
<p>compatible_data_dict_read(data_dict)</p>
<p>msg = generate_lmodel_update_message( \</p>
<p>self.id, model_id, models, performance_dict)</p>
<p>await send(msg, self.aggr_ip, self.msend_socket)</p>
<p>self.tran_state(ClientState.waiting_gm)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It first extracts data_dict and performance_dict using
    the load_model_file helper function and then pulls out the models
    and their ID from data_dict, based on
    the compatible_data_dict_read function. Then, the message is
    packaged with the generate_lmodel_update_message library and sent to
    the aggregator, with the send function from communication_handler.
    After that, the client state is changed to waiting_gm by
    the tran_state function. Again, the SSL/TSL framework can be added
    to secure communication, which is not implemented here to keep the
    FL client-side coding simple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following send_initial_model function is called when you want to
    send the initial <em>base model</em> to an aggregator of the model
    architecture for registration purposes. It takes initial models, the
    number of samples, and performance value as input and
    calls setup_sending_model, which will be explained later in this
    section:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def send_initial_model(self, initial_models, \</p>
<p>num_samples=1, perf_val=0.0):</p>
<p>self.setup_sending_models( \</p>
<p>initial_models, num_samples, perf_val)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The following send_trained_model function is called when you want to
    send trained local models to the aggregator during the FL cycle. It
    takes trained models, the number of samples, and performance value
    as input and only calls setup_sending_model if the client state
    is <em>not</em> gm_ready:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def send_trained_model(self, models, \</p>
<p>num_samples, perf_value):</p>
<p>state = self.read_state()</p>
<p>if state == ClientState.gm_ready:</p>
<p>pass</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>self.setup_sending_models( \</p>
<p>models, num_samples, perf_value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The following setup_sending_models function is designed to serve as
    an internal library to set up sending locally trained models to the
    aggregator. It takes parameters of models as np.array, the number of
    samples as an integer, and performance data as a float value:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def setup_sending_models(self, models, \</p>
<p>num_samples, perf_val):</p>
<p>model_id = generate_model_id( \</p>
<p>IDPrefix.agent, self.id, time.time())</p>
<p>data_dict = create_data_dict_from_models( \</p>
<p>model_id, models, self.id)</p>
<p>meta_data_dict = create_meta_data_dict( \</p>
<p>perf_val, num_samples)</p>
<p>save_model_file(data_dict, self.model_path, \</p>
<p>self.lmfile, meta_data_dict)</p>
<p>self.tran_state(ClientState.sending)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Basically, this function creates a unique model ID with
    the generate_model_id helper function, data_dict to store the local
    ML models data created with the create_data_dict_from_models helper
    function, and meta_data_dict to store the performance data created
    with the create_meta_data_dict helper function. And then, all the
    aforementioned data related to the models and performance is saved
    locally with the save_model_file function, in the location specified
    with self.model_path. Then, it changes the client state
    to sending so that the mode_exchange_routine function can note the
    change in the client state and start sending trained local models to
    the aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we know about the libraries to send ML models to the
    aggregator, let's learn about an important function to wait for a
    global model on the agent side.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Waiting for global models from an aggregator</p>
<ul>
<li>The following wait_for_global_model function is very important to
    conduct an FL cycle consistently:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def wait_for_global_model(self):</p>
<p>while (self.read_state() != ClientState.gm_ready):</p>
<p>time.sleep(5)</p>
<p>data_dict, _ = load_model_file( \</p>
<p>self.model_path, self.gmfile)</p>
<p>global_models = data_dict[\'models\']</p>
<p>self.tran_state(ClientState.training)</p>
<p>return global_models</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The principle is that the function waits until the client state
    becomes gm_ready. The transition of the client state
    to gm_ready happens when the global model is received on the agent
    side. Once the client state changes to gm_ready, it proceeds to load
    global models from data_dict, extracted with
    the load_model_file function, changes the client state to training,
    and returns the global models to the local ML module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have discussed how to design the libraries of FL client-side
    functions. In the next section, we will discuss how to integrate
    those libraries into a local ML process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Local ML engine integration into an FL system</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The successful integration of FL client libraries into a local ML
    engine is key to conducting FL in distributed environments later on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The minimal_MLEngine.py file in the examples/minimal directory found
    in the GitHub repository
    at <a href="https://github.com/tie-set/simple-fl">[https://github.com/tie-set/simple-fl]{.underline}</a>,
    as shown in <em>Figure 5.2</em>, provides an example of integrating FL
    client-side libraries into a minimal ML engine package:</p>

<li>Next, we will explain what libraries need to be imported into the
    local ML engine in the following section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importing libraries for a local ML engine</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The following code shows the importing process, where general
    libraries such as numpy, time, and Dict are imported first. The key
    part of this process is that Client is imported from
    the client.py file in the fl_main.agent folder. This way, a
    developer does not need to know too much about the code inside an FL
    system and just calls the important functionalities defined as
    libraries, as discussed in the <em>Toward designing FL client
    libraries</em> section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will not cover the pip installation packaging here in this book,
    but it is possible to host the client-side code with either a
    private or public PyPI server:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>import numpy as np</p>
<p>import time, logging, sys</p>
<p>from typing import Dict</p>
<p>from fl_main.agent.client import Client</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>After importing the necessary libraries, let's look at the functions
    defined for local training and testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining the ML models, training, and test functions</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You first define the models, training, and testing functions to be
    integrated into the FL system. In this code example, we will use
    dummy models and training/testing functions, allowing users to be
    able to understand the minimal FL procedure without being bothered
    by specific ML complications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following function called init_models returns the templates of
    models (in a dictionary format) to inform the ML model structure.
    The models do not need to be trained necessarily. In this case, the
    models have two layers defined by model1 and model2, where
    some random NumPy array is assigned to each layer, as follows:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def init_models() -&gt; Dict[str,np.array]:</p>
<p>models = dict()</p>
<p>models[\'model1\'] = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])</p>
<p>models[\'model2\'] = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])</p>
<p>return models</p>

<ul>
<li>After initializing the models, you will design the
    following training function that can be a placeholder function for
    each ML application:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def training(models: Dict[str,np.array],</p>
<p>init_flag: bool = False) -&gt; Dict[str,np.array]:</p>
<p># return templates of models to tell the structure</p>
<p># This model is not necessarily actually trained</p>
<p>if init_flag:</p>
<p>return init_models()</p>
<p># ML Training. In this example, no actual training.</p>
<p>models = dict()</p>
<p>models[\'model1\'] = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])</p>
<p>models[\'model2\'] = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])</p>
<p>return models</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The logic of this function should be in the order of taking models
    as input, training them, and returning trained local models. As
    input parameters, it takes models with
    the Dict[str,np.array] format and the init_flag Boolean value,
    indicating whether it is the initialization step or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>init_flag is True when you want to call and return the
    predefined init_models, and it is False if it's an actual training
    step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually, this function returns the trained models that are
    decomposed into NumPy arrays, with a dictionary
    of Dict[str,np.array] in this example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this dummy example, we are just giving you dummy models that skip
    the actual training process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, the following compute_performance function is designed to
    compute the performance of models given a set of models and a test
    dataset:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def compute_performance(models: Dict[str,np.array], \</p>
<p>testdata) -&gt; float:</p>
<p># replace with actual performance computation logic</p>
<p>accuracy = 0.5</p>
<p>return</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Again, in this example, just a dummy accuracy value is given, 0.5,
    to keep things simple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, you may want to define the
    following judge_termination function to decide the criteria to
    finish the training process and exit from the FL process:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def judge_termination(training_count: int = 0,</p>
<p>global_arrival_count: int = 0) -&gt; bool:</p>
<p># Depending on termination criteria, change the return bool value</p>
<p># Call a performance tracker to check if the current models
satisfy the required performance</p>
<p>return True</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is up to you how to design this termination condition. This
    function takes parameters such as the number of completed training
    processes (training_count), the number of times it received global
    models (global_arrival_count), and so on, returning a Boolean value
    where the flag is True if it continues the FL process and False if
    it stops. Here, it just gives a True Boolean value, meaning the FL
    process will not stop unless the agent is forced to stop outside of
    this function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If preparing the test data is needed, you can define a function such
    as prep_test_data:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def prep_test_data():</p>
<p>testdata = 0</p>
<p>return</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this example, it is just set as 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that the necessary functions for testing and training are
    defined, we will integrate client libraries into the local ML engine
    to run the FL agent working with the FL server-side components, such
    as an aggregator and a database.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Integration of client libraries into your local ML engine</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now, everything is ready to start your very first FL process,
    although the models, training, and testing functions are set with
    dummy variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The very first thing to do is to create a Client instance as follows
    so that you can call its libraries:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># Step1: Create Client instance</p>
<p>cl = Client()</p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<p>Second, you create the initial_models with the training function, as
follows:</p>
<p># Step2: Create template models (to tell the shapes)</p>
<p>initial_models = training(dict(), init_flag=True)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>After that, it sends the initial models to the FL aggregator by
    calling cl.send_initial_model, with initial_models as a parameter:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># Step3: Send initial models</p>
<p>cl.send_initial_model(initial_model)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Then, let's just start the client-side FL process by
    calling cl.start_fl_client(). As explained earlier in the <em>Starting
    FL client core threads</em> section, this function can start three
    processes at the same time: registering the agent, waiting for
    global models, and the model exchange routine:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># Step4: Start the FL client</p>
<p>cl.start_fl_client()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Then, we design the client-side FL cycle of local training/testing
    and sending/receiving models by effectively integrating the several
    FL client libraries, as follows:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># Step5: Run the local FL loop</p>
<p>training_count, gm_arrival_count = 0, 0</p>
<p>while judge_termination(training_count, gm_arrival_count):</p>
<p>global_models = cl.wait_for_global_model()</p>
<p>gm_arrival_count += 1</p>
<p>global_model_performance_data = \</p>
<p>compute_performance(global_models, prep_test_data())</p>
<p>models = training(global_models)</p>
<p>training_count += 1</p>
<p>perf_value = compute_performance( \</p>
<p>models, prep_test_data())</p>
<p>cl.send_trained_model(models, 1, perf_value)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We use a while loop and the judge_termination function to check
    whether the system needs to leave the loop. It is up to you to
    use training_count and gm_arrival_count to judge the termination of
    the FL cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, the agent proceeds to wait for the global models
    with cl.wait_for_global_model(). Upon the arrival of the global
    models from the aggregator, it extracts global_models,
    increments gm_arrival_count, and sets the client state to
    the training state in the wait_for_global_model function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, global_model_performance_data is calculated with
    the compute_performance function,
    taking global_models and prep_test_data as input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While executing training(global_models) in the training state, the
    client might receive new global models from the aggregator. This
    scenario happens when the client's local training was too slow, and
    the aggregator decided to utilize other local models to create a new
    set of global models. If the new global models have already arrived
    at the agent, the client's state is changed to gm_ready and the
    current ML model being trained will be discarded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the local training phase has finished with models generated
    by training(global_models), an agent increments training_count and
    calculates the performance data, perf_value, of the current ML model
    with the compute_performance function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, the agent tries to upload the trained local models to the
    aggregator via cl.send_trained_model, taking the trained models and
    the performance value calculated previously as parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the send_trained_model function, the client state is set
    to sending. Once the client's model_exchange_routine observes the
    state transition to the sending state, it sends the trained local
    models (stored as a binary file) to the aggregator. After sending
    the models, it goes back to the waiting_gm state in
    the send_models function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After sending the local models, the aggregator stores the uploaded
    local models in its buffers and waits for another round of global
    model aggregation, until enough local models are uploaded by agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next section, we will briefly talk about how to integrate
    image classification ML into the FL system we have discussed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of integrating image classification  into an FL system</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We learned about how to initiate an FL process with a minimal
    example. In this section, we will give a brief example of FL
    with <strong>image classification</strong> (<strong>IC</strong>) using a CNN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, the package that contains the image classification example
    code is found in the examples/image_classification/ folder in the
    GitHub repository
    at <a href="https://github.com/tie-set/simple-fl">[https://github.com/keshavaspanda/simple-fl]{.underline}</a>,
    as shown in <em>Figure 5.3</em>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 5.3 -- The image classification package

height="2.627083333333333in"}</p>
<p>Figure 5.3 -- The image classification package</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The main code in charge of integrating the IC algorithms into the FL
    systems is found in the classification_engine.py file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When importing the libraries, we use a couple of extra files that
    include CNN models, converter functions, and data managers related
    to IC algorithms. The details are provided in the GitHub code
    at <a href="https://github.com/tie-set/simple-fl">[https://github.com/keshavaspanda/simple-fl]{.underline}</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, let's import some standard ML libraries as well as client
    libraries from the FL code we discussed:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>import logging</p>
<p>import numpy as np</p>
<p>import torch</p>
<p>import torch.nn as nn</p>
<p>import torch.optim as optim</p>
<p>from typing import Dict</p>
<p>from .cnn import Net</p>
<p>from .conversion import Converter</p>
<p>from .ic_training import DataManger, execute_ic_training</p>
<p>from fl_main.agent.client import Client</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>In this case, we define TrainingMetaData, which just gives you the
    amount of training data that will be sent to the aggregator and used
    when conducting the FedAvg algorithm. The aggregation algorithm was
    discussed in <a href="https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/data/9781803247106/7/ch07lvl1sec42/B18369_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085"><em>section
    4</em></a>, <em>Federated
    Learning Server Implementation with Python</em>, as well as in <a href="https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/data/9781803247106/7/ch07lvl1sec42/B18369_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor176"><em>section
    7</em></a>, <em>Model
    Aggregation</em>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>class TrainingMetaData:</p>
<p># The number of training data used for each round</p>
<p># This will be used for the weighted averaging</p>
<p># Set to a natural number &gt; 0</p>
<p>num_training_data = 8000</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The content of the init_models function is now replaced with a CNN
    that is converted into a NumPy array. It returns the template of the
    CNN in a dictionary format to inform the structure:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def init_models() -&gt; Dict[str,np.array]:</p>
<p>net = Net()</p>
<p>return Converter.cvtr().convert_nn_to_dict_nparray(net)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The training function, training, is now filled with actual training
    algorithms using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It takes the models
    and init_flag as parameters and returns the trained models
    as Dict[str,np.array]. The init_flag is a bool value, where it
    is True if it's at the initial step and False if it's an actual
    training step. When preparing for the training data, we use a
    certain threshold for training due to batch size. In this case, the
    threshold is 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, we create a CNN-based cluster global model with net =
    Converter.cvtr().convert_dict_nparray_to_nn(models).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We define the loss function and optimizer as the following:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()</p>
<p>optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Then, the actual training will be conducted with trained_net =
    execute_ic_training(DataManger.dm(), net, criterion, optimizer),
    where the actual code of the IC training can be found in
    the ic_training.py file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the training, the converted models will be returned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The algorithm is summarized as follows:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def training(models: Dict[str,np.array], \</p>
<p>init_flag: bool=False) -&gt; Dict[str,np.array]:</p>
<p>if init_flag:</p>
<p>DataManger.dm( \</p>
<p>int(TrainingMetaData.num_training_data / 4))</p>
<p>return init_models()</p>
<p>net = \</p>
<p>Converter.cvtr().convert_dict_nparray_to_nn(models)</p>
<p>criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()</p>
<p>optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), \</p>
<p>lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)</p>
<p>trained_net = execute_ic_training(DataManger.dm(), \</p>
<p>net, criterion, optimizer)</p>
<p>models = Converter.cvtr(). \</p>
<p>convert_nn_to_dict_nparray(trained_net)</p>
<p>return models</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The following compute_performance function is filled with an
    algorithm to calculate the accuracy, which is simple enough -- just
    divide the number of correct outcomes by the number of total labels.
    With a given set of models and a test dataset, it computes the
    performance of the models, with models and testdata as parameters:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def compute_performance(models: Dict[str,np.array], \</p>
<p>testdata, is_local: bool) -&gt; float:</p>
<p># Convert np arrays to a CNN</p>
<p>net = \</p>
<p>Converter.cvtr().convert_dict_nparray_to_nn(models)</p>
<p>correct, total = 0, 0</p>
<p>with torch.no_grad():</p>
<p>for data in DataManger.dm().testloader:</p>
<p>images, labels = data</p>
<p>_, predicted = torch.max(net(images).data, 1)</p>
<p>total += labels.size(0)</p>
<p>correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()</p>
<p>acc = float(correct) / total</p>
<p>return acc</p>

<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The judge_termination and prep_test_data functions are the same as
    the functions of the minimal examples.</li>
</ul>
<p>Integration of client libraries into the IC example</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now, everything is ready to start the IC algorithm, and all the code
    to integrate the preceding functions is the same as that used in the
    previous <em>Integration of client libraries into your local ML
    engine</em> section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please look into the classification_engine.py file to make sure the
    code is the same, except for the part that shows the actual number
    of data samples that we are sending. This way, by just rewriting the
    preceding functions, you will be able to easily connect your own
    local ML application to the FL system that we have discussed here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please refer to the <em>Running image classification and its
    analysis</em> section, <em>Running the Federated Learning System and
    Analyzing the Results</em>, to check the results of running the code
    discussed in this section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here, we discussed FL client-side implementation. There are three
    basic but important functionalities when participating in the FL
    process, receiving global models sent from an aggregator with a push
    or polling mechanism, and sending local models to an aggregator
    after the local training process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to effectively implement the client-side ML engines that
    cooperate with the FL aggregator, understanding the client state is
    important. The client states include a state waiting for the global
    model, a state indicating that local training is happening, a state
    showing the readiness to send local models, and a state for having
    the updated global models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also discussed the design philosophy of FL client-side libraries,
    where the core functions need to be effectively packaged to provide
    user-friendly interfaces for ML developers and engineers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last but not least, we learned how to actually use the FL client
    libraries to integrate a local ML engine into an FL system, where we
    used the minimal dummy example and IC example to understand the
    integration process itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next section, we will actually run the code that was
    introduced in this and previous sections so that we can dig into
    what is happening with the models, which are aggregated with a
    minimal example as well as an IC example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Running the Federated Learning System and Analyzing the Results</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here, you will run the <strong>federated learning</strong> (<strong>FL</strong>) system that
    has been discussed in previous sections and analyze the system
    behaviors and the outcomes of the aggregated models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will start by explaining the configuration of the FL system
    components in order to run the systems properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basically, after installing the simple FL system provided by our
    GitHub sample, you first need to pick up the server machines or
    instances to run the database and aggregator modules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, you can run agents to connect to the aggregator that is
    already running. The IP address of the aggregator needs to be
    correctly set up in each agent-side configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, there is a simulation mode so that you can run all the
    components on the same machine or laptop to just test the
    functionality of the FL system. After successfully running all the
    modules of the FL system, you will be able to see the data folder
    and a database created under the path that you set up in the
    database server as well as on the agent side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be able to check both the local and global models, trained
    and aggregated, so that you can download the recent or
    best-performing models from the data folders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, you can also see examples of running the FL system on a
    minimal engine and image classification. By reviewing the outcomes
    of the generated models and the performance data, you can understand
    the aggregation algorithms as well as the actual interaction of the
    models between an aggregator and agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, we will cover the following main topics:</p>

<p>Understanding what happens when the minimal example runs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running image classification and analyzing the results</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical requirements</p>

<li>All the code files introduced Here can be found on GitHub
    (https://github.com/keshavaspanda/simple-fl).</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuring and running the FL system</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuring the FL system and installing its environment are simple
    enough to do. Follow the instructions in the next subsections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Installing the FL environment</p>
<ul>
<li>First, to run the FL system discussed in the previous section, clone
    the following repository to the machines that you want to run FL on
    using the following command:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>git clone https://github.com/keshavaspanda/simple-fl</strong></p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once done with the cloning process, change the directory to
    the simple-fl folder in the command line. The simulation run can be
    carried out using just one machine or using multiple systems. In
    order to run the FL process on one or multiple machines that include
    the FL server (aggregator), FL client (agent), and database server,
    you should create a conda virtual environment and activate it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To create a conda environment in macOS, you will need to type the
    following command:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>conda env create -n federatedenv -f ./setups/federatedenv.yaml</p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're using a Linux machine, you can create
    the conda environment by using the following command:</li>
</ul>
<p>conda env create -n federatedenv -f ./setups/federatedenv_linux.yaml</p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Then, activate the conda environment federatedenv when you run the
    code. For your information,
    the federatedenv.yaml and federatedenv_linux.yaml files can be found
    in the setups folder of the simple-fl GitHub repository and include
    the libraries that are used in the code examples throughout this
    book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As noted in the README file of the GitHub repo, there are mainly
    three components to run: the database server, aggregator, and
    agent(s). If you want to conduct a simulation within one machine,
    you can just install a conda environment (federatedenv) on that
    machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to create a distributed environment, you need to install
    the conda environment on all the machines you want to use, such as
    the database server on a cloud instance, the aggregator server on a
    cloud instance, and the local client machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that the installation process for the entire FL process is
    ready, let's move on to configuring the FL system with configuration
    files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Configuring the FL system with JSON files for each component</p>
<ul>
<li>First, edit the configuration JSON files in the setups folder of the
    provided GitHub repository. These JSON files are read by a database
    server, aggregator, and agents to configure their initial setups.
    Again, the configuration details are explained as follows.</li>
</ul>
<p>config_db.json</p>
<ul>
<li>The config_db.json file deals with configuring a database server.
    Use the following information to properly operate the server:</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-15-1" name="__codelineno-15-1" href="#__codelineno-15-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   db_ip: The database server's IP address (for example, localhost). If
    you want to run the database server on a cloud instance, such as
    an <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong>AWS</strong>) EC2 instance, you can specify
    the private IP address of the instance.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>db_socket: The socket number used between the database and
    aggregator (for example, 9017).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>db_name: The name of the SQLite database (for example, sample_data).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>db_data_path: The path to the SQLite database (for example, ./db).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>db_model_path: The path to the directory to save all <strong>Machine
    Learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>) models (for example, ./db/models).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>config_aggregator.json</p>

-   Now, the FL systems can be configured using the configuration files
    explained in this section. Next, you will run the database and
    aggregator on the FL server side.</p>
<p>Running the database and aggregator on the FL server</p>
<ul>
<li>In this section, you will configure the database and aggregator on
    the FL server side. Then, you will edit the configuration files in
    the setups folder of the simple-fl GitHub repo. After that, you will
    run pseudo_db first, and then server_th, as follows:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>python -m fl_main.pseudodb.pseudo_db</p>
<p>python -m fl_main.aggregator.server_th</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<p>Important note</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the database server and aggregator server are running on
    different machines, you will need to specify the IP address of the
    database server or instance of the aggregator. The IP address of the
    database server can be modified in the config_aggregator.json file
    in the setups folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, if both the database and aggregator instances are running in
    public cloud environments, the IP address of the configuration files
    of those servers needs to be the private IP address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agents need to connect to the aggregator using the public IP address
    and the connecting socket (port number) needs to be open to accept
    inbound messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After you start the database and aggregator servers, you will see a
    message such as the following in the console:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># Database-side Console Example</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Pseudo DB Started ---</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>On the aggregator side of the console, you will see something like
    the following:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># Aggregator-side Console Example</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Aggregator Started ---</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Behind this aggregator server, the model synthesis module is running
    every 5 seconds, where it starts checking whether the number of
    collected local models is more than the number that the aggregation
    threshold defines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have now run the database and aggregator modules and are ready to
    run a minimal example with the FL client.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Running a minimal example with the FL client</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the previous section, we talked about the integration of local ML
    engines into the FL system. Here, using a minimal sample that does
    not have actual training data, we will try to run the FL systems
    that have been discussed. This minimal example can be used as a
    template when implementing any locally distributed ML engine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before running the minimal example, you should check whether the
    database and aggregator servers are running already. Then, run the
    following command:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>python -m examples.minimal.minimal_MLEngine</p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this case, only one agent with a minimal ML engine is connected.
    Thus, the aggregation happens every time this default agent uploads
    the local model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that if the aggregator server is running on a different
    machine, you will need to specify the public IP address of the
    aggregator server or instance. The IP address of the aggregator can
    be modified in the config_agent.json file in the setups folder. We
    also recommend setting the polling flag to 1 when running the
    aggregator and database in a cloud instance.</p>

<p>Now we know how to run all the FL components: a database,
    aggregator, and agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next section, we will examine how outputs are generated by
    running the FL system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data and database folders</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After running the FL system, you will notice that the database
    folder and data folder are created under the locations that you
    specified in the config files of the database and agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, the db folder is created under db_data_path, written in
    the config_db.json file. In the database folder, you will find the
    SQLite database, such as model_data12345.db, where the metadata of
    local and cluster global models is stored, as well as
    a models folder that contains all the actual local models uploaded
    by the agents and global models created by the aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Figure 6.4</em> shows the SQLite database and ML model files in a
    binary file format stored in the db folder created by running the
    minimal example code:</p>

<li>Now we have learned how to configure and run the FL system with a
    minimal example and how to examine the results. In the next section,
    you will learn about the behavior of the FL system and what happens
    when the minimal example is run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding what happens when the minimal example runs</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the behavior of the entire FL system step by step will
    help you design applications with FL enabled and further enhance the
    FL system itself. Let us first look into what happens when we run
    just one agent by printing some procedures of the agent and
    aggregator modules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Running just one minimal agent</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's run the minimal agent after running the database and
    aggregator servers and see what happens. When the agent is started
    with the minimal ML engine, you will see the following messages in
    the agent console:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># Agent-side Console Example</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- This is a minimal example ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Agent initialized ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Your IP is xxx.xxx.1.101 ---</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>When the agent initializes the model to be used for FL, it shows
    this message, and if you look at the state file, it has entered
    the sending state, which will trigger sending models to the
    aggregator when the FL client is started:</li>

<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Then, after the client is started with the start_fl_client function,
    the participation message is sent to the aggregator. Here is the

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># DB-side Console Example</p>
<p>INFO:root:Request Arrived</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Model pushed: ModelType.cluster ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Cluster Models are saved ---</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This process in this section is repeated after cluster models are
    generated and saved for the upcoming FL round and the round of FL
    proceeds with this interaction mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you look at both the local and cluster global models, they are as
    follows:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>{</p>
<p>\'model1\': array([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6]]),</p>
<p>\'model2\': array([[1, 2],[3, 4]])</p>
<p>}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This means only one fixed model is used all the time even if
    aggregation happens, so the global model is exactly the same as the
    initial one as the dummy training process is used here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will now look into the results when running two minimal agents in
    the next section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Running two minimal agents</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With the database and aggregator servers running, you can run many
    agents using the minimal_MLEngine.py file in
    the simple-fl/examples/minimal folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should run the two individual agents from different local
    machines by specifying the IP address of the aggregator to connect
    those agents with the minimal ML example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also run multiple agents from the same machine for
    simulation purposes by specifying the different port numbers for the
    individual agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the code provided in the simple-fl repository on GitHub, you can
    run the multiple agents by using the following command:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>python -m examples.minimal.minimal_MLEngine [simulation_flag]
[gm_recv_port] [agent_name]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To conduct the simulation, simulation_flag should be set
    to 1. gm_recv_port is the port number to receive the global models
    from the aggregator. The agent will be notified of the port number
    by the aggregator through the response of a participation message.
    Also, agent_name is the name of the local agent and the directory
    name storing the state and model files. This needs to be unique for
    every agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, you can run the first and second agents with the
    following commands:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># First agent</p>
<p>python -m examples.minimal.minimal_MLEngine 1 50001 a1</p>
<p># Second agent</p>
<p>python -m examples.minimal.minimal_MLEngine 1 50002 a2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can edit the configuration JSON files in the setups folder if
    needed. In this case, agg_threshold is set to 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you run the simulation in the database server running a minimal
    example with multiple agents, the console screen will look similar
    to that in <em>Figure 6.1</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Figure 6.8</em> shows the console screen of a simulation in the
    aggregator server running a minimal example using dummy ML models:</p>

<li>Now we know how to run the minimal example with two agents. In order
    to further look into the FL procedure using this example, we will
    answer the following questions:</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-21-1" name="__codelineno-21-1" href="#__codelineno-21-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Has aggregation been done correctly for the simple cases?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Has the FedAvg algorithm been applied correctly?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does aggregation threshold work with connected agents?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-22-1" name="__codelineno-22-1" href="#__codelineno-22-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   After running and connecting the two agents, the aggregator will
    wait to receive two models from the two connected agents, as
    follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p># Aggregator-side Console Example</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Aggregation Threshold (Number of agents needed for
aggregation): 2 ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Number of collected local models: 0 ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Waiting for more local models to be collected ---</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this case, the aggregation threshold is set to 1.0 in
    the config_aggregator.json file in the setups folder, so the
    aggregator needs to collect all the models from connected agents,
    meaning it needs to receive local ML models from all the agents that
    are connected to the aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, it receives one model from one of the agents and the number of
    collected local models is increased to 1. However, as the aggregator
    is still missing one local model, it does not start aggregation yet:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># Aggregator-side Console Example</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Local Model Received ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Aggregation Threshold (Number of agents needed for
aggregation): 2 ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Number of collected local models: 1 ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Waiting for more local models to be collected ---</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the agent side, after the local models are sent to the
    aggregator, it will wait until the cluster global model to be
    created in the aggregator and sent back to the agent. In this way,
    you can synchronize the FL process at the agent side and automate
    the local training procedure when the global model is sent back to
    the agent and ready for retraining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the aggregator receives another local model, enough models are
    collected to start the aggregation process:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p># Aggregator-side Console Example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>INFO:root:--- Local Model Received ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Aggregation Threshold (Number of agents needed for
aggregation): 2 ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Number of collected local models: 2 ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Enough local models are collected. Aggregation will
start. ---</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>It will finally start the aggregation for the first round, as
    follows:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># Aggregator-side Console Example</p>

</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<p>Here, let's look at the agent-side ML models that are locally trained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p># Agent 1\'s Console Example</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Training ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Training is happening ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Training Done ---</p>
<p>Trained models: {\'model1\': array([[1, 2, 3],</p>
<p>[4, 5, 6]]), \'model2\': array([[1, 2],</p>
<p>[3, 4]])}</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Local (Initial/Trained) Models saved ---</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, let's look at another agent's ML models that are locally
    trained:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># Agent 2\'s Console Example</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Training ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Training is happening ---</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Training Done ---</p>
<p>Trained models: {\'model1\': array([[3, 4, 5],</p>
<p>[6, 7, 8]]), \'model2\': array([[3, 4],</p>
<p>[5, 6]])}</p>
<p>INFO:root:--- Local (Initial/Trained) Models saved ---</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As in the models sent to the aggregator from agents 1 and 2,
    if FedAvg is correctly applied, the global model should be the
    averaged value of these two models. In this case, the number of data
    samples is the same for both agents 1 and 2, so the global model
    should just be an average of the two models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, let's look at the global models that are generated in the
    aggregator:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># Agent 1 and 2\'s Console Example</p>
<p>Global Models: {\'model1\': array([[2., 3., 4.],</p>
<p>[5., 6., 7.]]), \'model2\': array([[2., 3.],</p>
<p>[4., 5.]])}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The received model is the average of the two local models and thus
    averaging has been correctly conducted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The database and data folders are created in
    the model_path specified in the agent configuration file. You can
    look at the database values with an SQLite viewer application and
    look for some models based on the model ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we understand what's happening with minimal example runs,
    in the next section, we will run a real ML application using an
    image classification model using a <strong>Convolutional Neural
    Network</strong> (<strong>CNN</strong>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Running image classification and analyzing the results</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This example demonstrates the use of this FL framework for
    image classification tasks. We will use a famous image dataset,
    CIFAR-10
    (URL: <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">[https://www.cs.toronto.edu/\~kriz/cifar.html]{.underline}</a>),
    to show how an ML model grows through the FL process over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, this example is only given for the purposes of using the FL
    system we have discussed so far and is not focused on maximizing the
    performance of the image classification task.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparing the CIFAR-10 dataset</p>
<ul>
<li>The following is the information required related to the dataset
    size, the training and test data, the number of classes, and the
    image size:</li>

-   The script to define the CNN model is already designed and can be
    found in cnn.py in examples/image_classification in
    the simple-fl repository on GitHub.</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, we will run the image classification application with the FL
    system.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to run the image classification example with CNN</p>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned in the installation steps at the beginning of This
    section, we first install the necessary libraries with federatedenv,
    and then install torch and torchvision after that:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>pip install torch</p>
<p>pip install torchvision</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can configure many settings through the JSON config files in
    the setups folder of the simple-fl repo of GitHub. For more details,
    you can read the general description of the config files in
    our setups documentation
    (<a href="https://github.com/tie-set/simple-fl/tree/master/setups">[https://github.comkeshavaspandat/simple-fl/tree/master/setups]{.underline}</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, you can run two agents. You can increase the number of agents
    running on the same device by specifying the appropriate port
    numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you already know, the first thing you can do is run the database
    and aggregator:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># FL server side</p>
<p>python -m fl_main.pseudodb.pseudo_db</p>
<p>python -m fl_main.aggregator.server_th</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Then, start the first and second agents to run the image
    classification example:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p># First agent</p>
<p>python -m examples.image_classification.classification</p>
<p>_engine 1 50001 a1</p>
<p># Second agent</p>
<p>python -m examples.image_classification.classification</p>
<p>_engine 1 50002 a2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To simulate the actual FL scenarios, the amount of training data
    accessible from each agent can be limited to a specific number. This
    should be specified with the num_training_data variable
    in classification_engine.py. By default, it uses 8,000 images (2,000
    batches) for each round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we can run the two agents to test the FL process using CNN
    models, let us look further into the results by running the image
    classification example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Evaluation of running the image classification with CNN</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The performance data (the accuracy of each local model cluster
    model) is stored in our database. You can access the
    corresponding .db file to see the performance history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DataManager instance (defined in ic_training.py) has a function
    to return one batch of images and their labels (get_random_images).
    You can use this function to show the actual labels and the
    predicted labels by the trained CNN on specific images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Figure 6.12</em> shows a plot of the learning performance from our
    experimental runs on our side; the results may look different when
    you run it with your own settings:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 6.12 -- Plot of the learning performance from the experimental
runs for FL using CNN for image classification

height="3.204861111111111in"}</p>
<p>Figure 6.12 -- Plot of the learning performance from the experimental
runs for FL using CNN for image classification</p>
<ul>
<li>Again, as we only use two agents here, the results just look
    slightly different. However, with the proper hyperparameter
    settings, data amount, and the number of agents, you will be able to
    carry out an FL evaluation that produces meaningful results, which
    we would like you to explore on your own, as the focus here is just
    how to connect the actual ML models to this FL environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Running five agents</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can easily run five agents for the image classification
    application by just specifying different port numbers and agent
    names in the terminal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The results look similar to what we discussed in the previous
    section except the real ML models are connected (in this case, the
    ML model being aggregated is CNN).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After running the five agents, the data and database folders look
    like in <em>Figure 6.13</em>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 6.13 -- Results to be stored in each folder with the agent's

<p>Figure 6.14 -- Information about the local models in the database </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you look at the database in <em>Figure 6.14</em>, there are five models
    collected by the five agents with local performance data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each round, those five local models are aggregated to produce a
    cluster global model, as in the cluster_models table in the
    database, as shown in <em>Figure 6.15</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The database storing cluster models has information about the
    cluster model ID, the time the models were generated, the ID of the
    aggregator that created the cluster model, and round information:</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Figure 6.15 -- Information about the cluster models in the database</p>
<ul>
<li>In this way, you can connect as many agents as possible. It is up to
    you to optimize the settings of the local ML algorithms to obtain
    the best-performing federated models out of the FL system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here, we discussed the execution of FL systems in detail and how the
    system will behave according to the interactions between the
    aggregator and agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The step-by-step explanation of the FL system behavior based on the
    outcomes of the console examples guides you to understand the
    aggregation process of the FedAvg algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, the image classification example showed how CNN models
    are connected to the FL system and how the FL process increases the
    accuracy through aggregation, although this was not optimized to
    maximize the training results but simplified to validate the
    integration using CNN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With what you have learned Here, you will be able to design your own
    FL applications integrating the principles and framework introduced
    in this book, and furthermore, will be able to assess the FL
    behavior on your own to see whether the whole flow of the FL process
    and model aggregation is happening correctly and consistently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next section, we will cover a variety of model aggregation
    methods and show how FL works well with those aggregation
    algorithms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Model Aggregation</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the <em>Model aggregation basics</em> section of <em>section 3</em>, <em>Workings
    of the Federated Learning System</em>, we introduced the concept of
    aggregation within the <strong>federated learning</strong> (<strong>FL</strong>) process at a
    high level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recall that aggregation is the means by which an FL approach uses
    the models trained locally by each agent to produce a model with
    strong global performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is clear to see that the strength and robustness of the
    aggregation method employed are directly correlated to the resulting
    performance of the end global model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, choosing the appropriate aggregation method based on
    the local datasets, agents, and FL system hierarchy is key to
    achieving good performance with FL. In fact, the focal point of many
    publications in this field is providing mathematically backed
    convergence guarantees for these methods in a variety of theoretical
    scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal of This section is to cover some of the research that has
    been done on aggregation methods and their convergence in both ideal
    and non-ideal cases, tying these methods to their strengths in the
    different scenarios that arise in the practical applications of FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After reading the section, you should be able to understand how
    different characterizations of an FL scenario call for different
    aggregation methods, and you should have an idea of how these
    algorithms can actually be implemented.</p>

<p>The Python algorithm implementations presented in this work can all
    be found in the ch7 folder, which is
    located at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Federated-Learning-with-Python/tree/main/ch7">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Federated-Learning-with-Python/tree/main/ch7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the pure aggregation algorithms, auxiliary code is included to
    display example output from preset local parameters. The aggregation
    methods that modify the local training process require an FL system
    in order to operate -- for these, full implementations using STADLE
    are included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, the pure aggregation algorithms can be directly tested with
    STADLE by configuring the aggregation method. Information on how to
    run the examples can be found in the associated README files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The installation of the stadle-client package through pip is
    necessary to run the full FL process examples. The following command
    can be used to perform this installation:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>pip install stadle-client</p>

<ul>
<li>Using a virtual environment is recommended to isolate the specific
    package versions installed with stadle-client from other
    installations on the system.</li>

<p>Revisiting aggregation</p>
<ul>
<li>To solidly contextualize aggregation within FL, first, we describe
    the components of a system that are necessary for FL to be applied:</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-28-1" name="__codelineno-28-1" href="#__codelineno-28-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   A set of computational agents that perform the local training
    portion of FL.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each agent possesses a local dataset (static or dynamic), of which
    no portion can be communicated to another agent under the
    strictest FL scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each agent possesses a parameterized model that can be trained on
    the local dataset, a process that produces the local optima
    parameter set for the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A parameter server, or aggregator, which receives the locally
    trained models at each iteration from the agents and sends back the
    resulting model produced by the aggregation method chosen to be
    used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-29-1" name="__codelineno-29-1" href="#__codelineno-29-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Every FL communication round can then be broken down into the
    following two phases:</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-30-1" name="__codelineno-30-1" href="#__codelineno-30-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   The <em>local training phase</em>, where agents train their local models on
    their local datasets for some number of iterations</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>aggregation phase</em>, where the agents send the resulting trained
    local models from the previous phase to the aggregator and receive
    the aggregated model for use as the starting model in the local
    training phase of the next round.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-31-1" name="__codelineno-31-1" href="#__codelineno-31-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   So, what exactly does it mean for an agent to send a locally trained
    model during the aggregation phase?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The general approach is to use the <em>parameter sets</em> that define the
    local models, allowing for some degree of generalization across all
    models that can be parameterized in such a way. However, a second
    approach focuses on sending the <em>local gradients</em> accumulated during
    the local training when using a gradient-based optimization approach
    to the aggregator, with the agents updating their models using the
    received aggregate gradient at the end of the round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While this approach restricts usage to models with gradient-based
    local training methods, the prevalence of such methods when training
    deep learning models has led to a subset of aggregation methods
    based on gradient aggregation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, we choose to frame model aggregation through the lens of
    the FedAvg algorithm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding FedAvg</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Earlier, the aggregation algorithm known as FedAvg was introduced to
    help clarify the general structure and represent the more abstract
    concepts discussed earlier with a specific example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FedAvg was used for two reasons: simplicity in the underlying
    algorithm, and generalizability across more model types than
    gradient-based approaches. It also benefits from extensive
    references by researchers, with performance analysis in different
    theoretical scenarios using FedAvg as a baseline when proposing new
    aggregation methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This focus in the research community can most likely be attributed
    to the fact that the original FedAvg paper was published by the team
    working at Google that first brought exposure to the concept and
    benefits of FL. For further reading, this paper can be
    found at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629?context=cs">https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629?context=cs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FedAvg is predated by an aggregation approach known as <strong>Federated
    Stochastic Gradient Descent</strong> (<strong>FedSGD</strong>). FedSGD can be viewed as
    the gradient aggregation analog of the model parameter averaged
    performed by FedAvg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, the concept of averaging model parameters was examined
    prior to FedAvg for parallelized SGD approaches, outside of the
    context of FL. Essentially, the analysis of these parallelized SGD
    approaches mirrors the <strong>Independently and Identically
    Distributed</strong> (<strong>IID</strong>) case of FedAvg -- this concept will be
    discussed later in the section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regardless, the simplicity, generalizability, and popularity of
    FedAvg make it a good base to delve deeper into, contextualizing the
    need for the numerous aggregation approaches discussed in later
    sections that have built upon or, otherwise, improved on FedAvg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previously, FedAvg was only presented as an algorithm that takes
    models <img alt="" src="../images/media/image21.png" />{width="1.4427088801399826in"
    height="0.23811679790026247in"}with a respective local dataset size
    of <img alt="" src="../images/media/image37.png" />{width="1.3452384076990376in"
    height="0.20833333333333334in"}, where the sum equals <em>N</em> and
    returns:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/media/image56.jpg" />{width="2.026042213473316in"
height="0.9540912073490814in"}</p>
<p>As shown in the <em>Aggregating local models</em> section of <em>section
4</em>, <em>Federated Learning Server Implementation with
Python</em>, <em>simple-fl</em> uses the following function to compute a weighted
average of the buffered models (models sent from clients during the
current round) based on the amount of data used to locally train each
model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>def _average_aggregate(self,</p>
<p>buffer: List[np.array],</p>
<p>num_samples: List[int]) -&gt; np.array:</p>
<p>\"\"\"</p>
<p>Given a list of models, compute the average model (FedAvg).</p>
<p>This function provides a primitive mathematical operation.</p>
<p>:param buffer: List[np.array] - A list of models to be
aggregated</p>
<p>:return: np.array - The aggregated models</p>
<p>\"\"\"</p>
<p>denominator = sum(num_samples)</p>
<p># weighted average</p>
<p>model = float(num_samples[0]) / denominator * buffer[0]</p>
<p>for i in range(1, len(buffer)):</p>
<p>model += float(num_samples[i]) / denominator *
buffer[i]</p>
<p>return model</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The original algorithm does not differ too greatly from this
    portrayal. The high-level steps of the algorithm are as follows:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server randomly samples <em>K * C</em> clients, where <em>K</em> is the total
    number of clients and <em>C</em> is a parameter between 0 and 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The selected <em>K * C</em> clients receive the most recent aggregate
    model and begin to train the model on their local data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each client sends its locally trained model back to the server after
    some desired amount of training is completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server computes the parameter-wise arithmetic mean of the
    received models to compute the newest aggregate model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parallels can be immediately drawn between this formal
    representation and our presentation of the FL process,
    with ClientUpdate performing local training for an agent and the
    server performing aggregation using the same weighted averaging
    algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One important point is the sampling of a subset of clients to
    perform the local training and model transmission during each round,
    allowing for client subsampling parameterized by C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This parameter is included to experimentally determine the
    convergence rates of various client set sizes -- in an ideal
    scenario, this will be set to 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As previously mentioned, FedAvg is the ideal FL scenario that
    essentially mirrors an approach to parallelized stochastic gradient
    descent. In <strong>parallelized SGD</strong> (<strong>pSGD</strong>), the goal is to leverage
    hardware parallelization (for example, running on multiple cores in
    parallel) in order to speed up SGD convergence on a specific machine
    learning task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One approach for this task is for each core to train a base model on
    some subset of the data in parallel for some number of iterations,
    then aggregate the partially trained models and use the aggregated
    models as the next base for training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this case, if the cores are considered to be agents in an FL
    scenario, the parallelized SGD approach is the same as FedAvg in an
    ideal scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means all of the convergence guarantees and respective analyses
    that were done for pSGD can be directly applied to FedAvg, assuming
    the ideal FL scenario. From this prior work, it has, therefore, been
    shown that FedAvg demonstrates strong convergence rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After all this praise for FedAvg, it is only natural to question why
    more complex aggregation methods are even necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recall that the phrase "ideal FL scenario" was used several times
    when discussing FedAvg convergence. The unfortunate reality is that
    most practical FL applications will fail to meet one or more of the
    conditions stipulated by that phrase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ideal FL scenario can be broken down into three main conditions:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-32-1" name="__codelineno-32-1" href="#__codelineno-32-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   The local datasets used for training are IID (the datasets are
    independently drawn from the same data distribution).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The computational agents are relatively homogeneous in computational
    power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All agents can be assumed to be non-adversarial.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-33-1" name="__codelineno-33-1" href="#__codelineno-33-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   At a high level, it is clear why these qualities would be desirable
    in an FL scenario. To understand, in greater detail, why these three
    conditions are necessary, the performance of FedAvg in the absence
    of each condition will be examined in the upcoming subsections.</p>
<p>Dataset distributions</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To examine FedAvg in the non-IID case, first, it is important
    to define what exactly is being referred to by the distribution of a
    dataset. In classification problems, the data distribution often
    refers to the distribution of the true classes associated with each
    data point. For example, consider the MNIST dataset, where each
    image is a handwritten digit from 0 to 9.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a uniform random sample of 1,000 images was to be taken from the
    dataset, the expected number of images from each class would be the
    same -- this could be considered a uniform data distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, a sample with 910 images of the digit 0 along with 10
    images of the other digits would be a heavily skewed data
    distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To generalize outside of classification tasks, this definition can
    be extended to refer to the distribution of <em>features</em> present
    across the dataset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These features could be manually crafted and provided to the model
    (such as linear regression), or they could be extracted from the raw
    data as part of the model pipeline (such as deep CNN models).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For classification problems, the class distribution is generally
    contained within the feature distribution, due to the implicit
    belief that the features are sufficient for correctly predicting the
    class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The benefit of looking at feature distributions is the data-centric
    focus on features (versus the task-centric focus on classes),
    allowing for generalization across machine learning tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, in the context of experimental analysis, the ability to
    easily construct non-IID samples from a dataset makes classification
    tasks ideal for testing the robustness of FedAvg and different
    aggregation methods within an FL context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To examine FedAvg in this section, consider a toy FL scenario where
    each agent trains a CNN on data samples taken from the MNIST dataset
    described earlier. There are two main cases, which are detailed
    next.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IID case</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The convergence of the models can be represented through the use of
    the model parameter space. The parameter space of a model
    with <em>n</em> parameters can be thought of as an <em>n</em>-dimensional
    Euclidean space, where each parameter corresponds to one dimension
    in the space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider an initialized model; the initial parameters of this model
    can then be represented as a <em>point</em> in the parameter space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As local training and aggregation occur, this representative point
    will move in the parameter space, with the end goal being
    convergence to a point in the space corresponding to a local optimum
    of the loss or error function being minimized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One key point of these functions is the dependence on the data used
    during the local training process -- when the datasets across the
    agents are IID, there is a general tendency for the optima of the
    respective loss/error functions to be relatively close in the
    parameter space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider a trivial case where the datasets are IID and all models
    are initialized with the same parameters. As shown in the <em>Model
    aggregation basics </em>section of <em>section 3</em>, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Workings of the Federated Learning System</em>, a simplified version of
    the parameter space can be depicted:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 7.1 -- Models with the same initialization and IID datasets
" src="../images/media/image44.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="4.855555555555555in"}</p>
<p>Figure 7.1 -- Models with the same initialization and IID datasets</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Observe how both models start at the same point (purple x) and move
    toward the same optima (purple dot), resulting in aggregate models
    close to the optima shared by both models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to the resulting similarity of the error/loss functions across
    the agents, the models tend to converge toward the same or similar
    optima in the space during training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that the change in the models after each aggregation step
    is relatively small, resulting in the convergence rates mirroring
    the single local model case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the underlying data distribution is representative of the true
    data distribution (for example, uniform across the 10 different
    digits for MNIST), the resulting aggregated model will
    demonstrate strong performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, consider the generalized IID case where each model
    is initialized separately:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 7.2 -- Models with different initializations and IID datasets
" src="../images/media/image55.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="4.747222222222222in"}</p>
<p>Figure 7.2 -- Models with different initializations and IID datasets</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this scenario, observe how both models start at different points
    (bold/dotted <em>x</em>) and initially move toward different optima,
    producing a poor first model. However, after the first aggregation,
    both models start at the same point and move toward the same optima,
    resulting in similar convergence to the first case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should be clear that this reduces to the previous case after the
    first aggregation step since each model starts the second round with
    the resulting aggregated parameters. As a result, the convergence
    properties previously stated can be extended to the general case of
    FedAvg with IID local datasets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-IID Case</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The key property in the IID local dataset case that allows for
    convergence speeds mirroring the single model case is the similarity
    of the local optima of the loss/error functions, due to their
    construction from similar data distributions. In the non-IID case,
    similarity in the optima is generally no longer observed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the MNIST example, let's consider an FL scenario with two
    agents such that the first agent only has images with digits 0 to 4
    and the second agent only has images with digits 5 to 9; that is,
    the datasets are not IID. These datasets would essentially lead to
    two completely different five-class classification tasks at the
    local training level, as opposed to the original 10-class
    classification problem -- this will result in completely different
    parameter space optima between the first agent and the second agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the simplified representation of this parameter space as
    follows, with both models having the same initialization:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 7.3 -- Models with different initializations and non-IID
datasets " src="../images/media/image49.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="4.8597222222222225in"}</p>
<p>Figure 7.3 -- Models with different initializations and non-IID datasets</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now that optima are no longer shared (triangles/squares representing
    optima for bold/dotted model, respectively), even
    repeated aggregations cannot create an aggregate model close to
    optima of either model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The models diverge, or drift, during each local training phase due
    to the different target optima in each round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only a small subset of the optima will be shared between the
    loss/error functions of both agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, there is a high probability that each model will move
    toward optima that are not shared during local training, leading the
    models to drift apart in the parameter space. Each aggregation step
    will then pull the models toward the wrong optima, reverting the
    progress made during local training and hampering convergence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that just taking the average of optima from different agents is
    very unlikely to be near optima from any of the agents in the
    parameter space, so in this case, the result of continued
    aggregation is generally a model that performs poorly across the
    whole dataset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convergence to a shared optimum might eventually occur due to
    stochasticity observed during local training, inducing movement of
    the aggregate model in the parameter space, but this does not have
    theoretical guarantees and will be far slower than convergence in
    the IID case when it does occur.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Important note</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This MNIST example is a theoretical extreme of non-IID datasets. In
    practice, non-IID datasets might refer to different skews in the
    data distributions across agents (for example, twice as many images
    with digits 0--4 versus 5--9, and vice versa).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The severity of the difference is correlated to the performance of
    FedAvg, so adequate performance can still be reached in less severe
    cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, in these cases, the performance of FedAvg will generally
    always be inferior to the analogous centralized training task where
    a single model is trained on all of the local datasets at once --
    the theoretically optimal model achievable by FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While this section focused on the statistical basis for the issues
    that arise from non-IID datasets, the next section examines a far
    more direct problem that can arise -- especially when deploying
    at larger scales.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Computational power distributions</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An unstated assumption of the agents participating in FL is that
    each agent is capable of performing local training if given infinite
    time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agents with limited computational power (memory and speed) might
    take significantly more time than other agents to finish local
    training, or they might require techniques such as quantization to
    support the model and training process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, agents that cannot complete local training during some
    rounds will trivially prevent convergence by stalling the FL
    process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally, convergence bounds and experimental results focus on the
    number of communication rounds required to reach some level of
    performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under this metric and the aforementioned assumption, convergence is
    completely independent of the computational power afforded to each
    agent, since computational power only affects the actual time
    necessary to complete one round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, convergence speed in practical applications is measured by
    the actual time taken, not the number of completed communication
    rounds -- this means that the time to complete each round is as
    important as the number of rounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This metric of the total time taken is where naïve FedAvg
    demonstrates poor performance when heterogeneous computation power
    is observed in the agents participating in FL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifically, the time to complete each round is bottlenecked by the
    local training time of the slowest agent participating in the round;
    this is because aggregation is trivially fast compared to training
    in most cases and must wait for all agents to complete local
    training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When all agents are participating in the round, this bottleneck
    becomes the slowest overall agent. In the homogeneous computational
    power case, the difference in local training time between the
    fastest agent and the slowest agent will be relatively
    insignificant. In the heterogeneous case, a single straggler will
    greatly reduce the convergence time of FedAvg and lead to
    significant idle time in the faster agents waiting to receive
    the aggregated model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two modifications to FedAvg with full agent participation might
    initially seem to address this problem; however, both have drawbacks
    that lead to suboptimal performance:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-34-1" name="__codelineno-34-1" href="#__codelineno-34-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   One approach is to rely on agent subsampling in each round, leading
    to the probability of the straggler effect occurring in each round
    depending on the number of agents and the sample size taken in each
    round. This can be sufficient in cases with only a few straggling
    agents, but it becomes proportionately worse as this number
    increases and does not completely eliminate the problem from
    occurring. In addition, small sample sizes lose out on the
    robustness benefits from aggregation over more agents.</p>
<ul>
<li>A second approach is to allow all agents to begin local training at
    the beginning of each round and prematurely begin aggregation after
    some number of models have been received. This method has the
    benefit of being able to completely eliminate the straggler effect
    without greatly restricting the number of agents participating in
    aggregation during each round. However, it results in the slowest
    agents never participating in aggregation over all rounds,
    essentially reducing the number of active agents and potentially
    limiting the variety of data used during training. In addition, the
    agents that are too slow to participate in aggregation will have
    done computational work for no benefit.</li>
</ul>

-   It is clear that some local adjustment based on available
    computational power is necessary for aggregation to be performed
    efficiently, regardless of the end aggregation method applied to the
    received models at the end of each round.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both the non-IID case and the heterogeneous computation power case
    focus on properties of an FL system that are generally easy to
    observe and under some level of administrative control. The next
    case we present deviates from this by challenging a key assumption
    when considering practical FL systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Protecting against adversarial agents</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So far, it has been assumed that every agent participating in an FL
    scenario always acts in the desired way; that is, actively and
    correctly training the received model locally and participating in
    model transmission to/from the aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is easily achieved in a research setting, where the federated
    setting is simulated and the agents are singularly controlled;
    however, this assumption of agents behaving correctly does not
    always hold in practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One example that does not involve targeted malicious intent is an
    error in the model weights being transmitted by an agent to the
    aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This can happen when the dataset used by an agent is flawed or the
    training algorithm is incorrectly implemented (the corruption of the
    parameter data during transmission is also possible). In the worst
    case, this can essentially lead to the parameters of one or many
    models being statistically equivalent to random noise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the L2 norm (the extension of vector magnitude
    for <em>n</em>-dimensional tensors) of the random noise is not
    significantly greater than that of the valid models,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FedAvg will suffer performance loss that is proportional to the
    ratio of faulty agents to all agents -- which is relatively
    acceptable when this ratio is small. However, even a single faulty
    agent can induce a near-random aggregate model if the norm of the
    agent's noise is significantly high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is due to the nature of the arithmetic mean being performed
    internally during the FedAvg aggregation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The problem becomes worse when agents can be controlled by malicious
    adversaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A single malicious agent with sufficient information is capable of
    producing any desired model after aggregation through large
    modifications to the parameters of the model it submits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even without direct knowledge of the model parameters and associated
    weights of the other agents, a malicious agent can leverage
    relatively small changes between the local models and the aggregate
    model in later rounds to use the previous aggregate model as an
    estimate of the expected local model parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, FedAvg offers little to no robustness against both random
    and controlled adversarial agents in an FL setting. While one
    potential means of mitigation would be to separately monitor the
    agents and prevent adversarial agents from transmitting models,
    significant damage to the convergence of the final model might have
    already occurred in the time necessary to identify such agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It should now be clear that FedAvg trades robustness in these
    non-ideal cases for simplicity in the calculation. Unfortunately,
    this robustness is a key consideration for practical applications of
    FL due to the lack of control compared to the research setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next section focuses on methods of achieving robustness against
    the three non-ideal cases presented in this section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Modifying aggregation for non-ideal cases</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In practical FL applications, at least one of the aforementioned
    assumptions that constitute an ideal FL scenario generally does not
    hold; therefore, the usage of alternative aggregation methods might
    be necessary to best perform FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal of this section is to cover examples of aggregation methods
    that target heterogeneous computational power, adversarial agents,
    and non-IID datasets, in order of difficulty.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Handling heterogeneous computational power</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the ideal aggregation approach, in this case,
    consistently avoids the straggler effect while maximizing the number
    of agents participating in FL and allowing all agents to contribute
    to some extent, regardless of computational power differences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agents become stragglers during a round when their local training
    takes significantly more time than the majority of the agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, effectively addressing this problem actually requires
    some level of adaptability at the agent level in the local
    training process, based on the computational power available to each
    agent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Manual adjustment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One straightforward way of accomplishing this is to change the
    number of local training iterations based on the time necessary for
    each iteration. In other words, the local training time is fixed and
    each agent performs as many iterations as possible within this time,
    as opposed to performing a fixed number of iterations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This trivially eliminates the straggler problem but might result in
    poor performance if a large amount of local training time must be
    allocated for the slow agents to meaningfully contribute due to the
    model drift from faster agents potentially performing too many local
    training iterations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This can be mitigated by setting a maximum number of local training
    iterations. However, a careful balance in the allocated local
    training must be found to have enough time for slow agents to
    produce adequate models while preventing faster agents from sitting
    idle after reaching the maximum number of iterations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also unclear how such a threshold could be preemptively
    determined to achieve optimal performance instead of relying on
    experimental results to search for the best configuration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Automatic adjustment -- FedProx</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An aggregation method known as FedProx follows this same methodology
    of dynamically adjusting the local training processes for each agent
    based on computational power, while also revising the termination
    condition for local training to aid in the theoretical analysis of
    convergence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifically, the fixed number of local training iterations is
    replaced by a termination condition for the training loop that
    accommodates agents with varying levels of computational power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The underlying concept for this termination condition is the
    γ-inexact solution, which is satisfied when the magnitude of the
    gradient at the γ-inexact optima is less than γ times the magnitude
    of the gradient at the beginning of local training. Intuitively, γ
    is a value between 0 and 1, with values closer to 0 leading to more
    local training iterations due to the stricter termination condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, γ allows for the parameterization of an
    agent's computational power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One potential problem with the termination condition approach is the
    divergence of the locally trained model from the aggregate model
    after many iterations of local training resulting from a strict
    condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To combat this, FedProx adds a proximal term to the objective
    function being minimized equal to the following:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/media/image45.jpg" />{width="1.1302088801399826in"
height="0.40687554680664917in"}</p>
<p>Here, <img alt="" src="../images/media/image64.png" />{width="0.5311986001749781in"
height="0.26833770778652666in"} represents the received aggregate model
weights.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The proximal term penalizes differences between the current weights
    and the aggregated model weights, restricting the aforementioned
    local model divergence with the strength parameterized by μ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From these two concepts, FedProx allows for a variable number of
    iterations proportional to the computational power to be performed
    by each agent without requiring manually tuned iteration counts for
    each agent or a set amount of allocated training time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of the addition of the proximal term, FedProx requires
    gradient-based optimization methods to be employed in order to work
    -- more information on the underlying theory and comparison to
    FedAvg can be found in the original paper (which
    is at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06127">https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06127</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing FedProx</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because the modifications made by FedProx to FedAvg are all on the
    client side, the actual implementation of FedProx consists entirely
    of modifications to the local training framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifically, FedProx involves a new termination condition for local
    training and the addition of a constraining term to the local loss
    function. Therefore, it is helpful to use an example of the local
    training code to frame exactly how FedProx can be integrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's consider the following generic training code using PyTorch:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>agg_model = ... # Get aggregate model -- abstracted out of example</p>
<p>model.load_state_dict(agg_model.state_dict())</p>
<p>for epoch in range(num_epochs):</p>
<p>for batch_idx, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(trainloader):</p>
<p>inputs, targets = inputs.to(device), targets.to(device)</p>
<p>optimizer.zero_grad()</p>
<p>outputs = model(inputs)</p>
<p>loss = criterion(outputs, targets)</p>
<p>loss.backward()</p>
<p>optimizer.step()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let this be the code that performs num_epochs epochs of training on
    the local dataset using the received aggregate model for each round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first necessary modification for FedProx is to replace the
    fixed number of epochs with a dynamic termination condition,
    checking whether a γ-inexact solution has been found with the
    aggregated model as the initial model. To do this, the total
    gradient over the entire training dataset for the aggregate model
    and the current local model must be stored -- this can be
    performed as follows:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>agg_model = ... # Get aggregated model from aggregator</p>
<p>model.load_state_dict(agg_model.state_dict())</p>
<p>agg_grad = None</p>
<p>curr_grad = None</p>
<p>gamma = 0.9</p>
<p>mu = 0.001</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Values for the two FedProx parameters, gamma and mu, are set, and
    variables to store the gradients of both the aggregate model and the
    latest local model are defined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then define the γ-inexact new termination condition for local
    training using these gradient variables:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def gamma_inexact_solution_found(curr_grad, agg_grad, gamma):</p>
<p>if (curr_grad is None):</p>
<p>return False</p>
<p>return curr_grad.norm(p=2) \&lt; gamma * agg_grad.norm(p=2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>This condition is now checked before each training loop iteration to
    determine when to stop local training. The total_grad variable is
    created to store the cumulative gradients that were created from
    each minibatch during backpropagation:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>model.train()</p>
<p>while (not gamma_inexact_solution_found(curr_grad, agg_grad, gamma)):</p>
<p>total_grad = torch.cat([torch.zeros_like(param.data.flatten())
for param in model.parameters()])</p>
<p>for batch_idx, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(trainloader):</p>
<p>inputs, targets = inputs.to(device), targets.to(device)</p>
<p>optimizer.zero_grad()</p>
<p>outputs = model(inputs)</p>
<p>loss = criterion(outputs, targets)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>To compute the proximal term, the weights of both the aggregate
    model and the latest local model are computed. From these weights,
    the proximal term is computed and added to the loss term:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>curr_weights = torch.cat([param.data.flatten() for param in
model.parameters()])</p>
<p>agg_weights = torch.cat([param.data.flatten() for param in
agg_model.parameters()])</p>
<p>prox_term = mu * torch.norm(curr_weights - agg_weights,
p=2)**2</p>
<p>loss += prox_term</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The gradients are computed and added to the cumulative sum
    stored in total_grad:</li>
</ul>
<p>loss.backward()</p>
<p>grad = torch.cat([param.grad.flatten() for param in
model.parameters()])</p>
<p>total_grad += grad</p>
<p>optimizer.step()</p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we update agg_grad (if the gradients were computed with the
    aggregate weights) and curr_grad after the current local training
    iteration is completed:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>if (agg_grad == None):</p>
<p>agg_grad = total_grad</p>
<p>curr_grad = total_grad</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These modifications allow for FedProx to be implemented on top of
    FedAvg. The full FL example using FedProx can be
    found at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Federated-Learning-with-Python/tree/main/ch7/agg_fl_examples/cifar_fedprox_example">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Federated-Learning-with-Python/tree/main/ch7/agg_fl_examples/cifar_fedprox_example</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An auxiliary approach to handle the heterogeneous computational
    power scenario that helps with computational efficiency when only
    mild heterogeneity is observed is the idea of <em>compensation in
    aggregation</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-36-1" name="__codelineno-36-1" href="#__codelineno-36-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;

-   Consider the case where aggregation occurs once the number of
    received models surpasses some threshold (generally, this is less
    than the number of participating agents). Using this threshold
    allows the straggler effect to be mitigated; however, the work done
    by slower agents ends up being discarded each round, leading
    to training inefficiency.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The core idea of compensation is to allow for the local training
    that is done by a slower agent in one round to instead be included
    in the model aggregation of a subsequent round. The age of the model
    is compensated for in this subsequent round by multiplying the
    weight used for the weighted average and a penalizing term during
    aggregation. By doing so, slower agents can be given two or three
    times as much training time as that used by the faster agents while
    avoiding the straggler effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mild heterogeneity is required in order to prevent cases where
    slower agents require too much extra time for training. This is due
    to the associated penalty given to the model after many rounds have
    passed; it will be severe enough to effectively lead to no
    contribution and reduce aggregation without compensation -- this is
    necessary to prevent models that are too old from hampering the
    convergence of the aggregate model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we examine methods that help to address the third non-ideal
    property, where some subset of agents are controlled by an adversary
    or are, otherwise, behaving in an undesirable way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adversarial agents</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the previous section, it was shown that the core problem with
    FedAvg in the presence of adversarial agents was the lack of
    robustness to outliers in the underlying arithmetic mean used during
    aggregation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This naturally raises the question of whether this mean can be
    estimated in such a manner that does offer such robustness. The
    answer is the class of robust mean estimators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many such estimators that offer varying trade-offs between
    robustness, distance from the true arithmetic mean,
    and computational efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For use as a base for the implementation of the following
    aggregation methods, consider the following general aggregation
    function:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def aggregate(parameter_vectors):</p>
<p># Perform some form of aggregation</p>
<p>return aggregated_parameter_vector</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This function takes a list of parameter vectors and returns the
    resulting aggregated parameter vector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we will examine three example implementations of robust mean
    estimators.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aggregation using the geometric median</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The geometric median of a sample is the point minimizing the sum of
    L1 distances between itself and the sample. This is conceptually
    similar to the arithmetic mean, which is the point minimizing the
    sum of L2 distances between itself and the sample.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of L1 distances allows for greater robustness to outliers;
    in fact, an arbitrary point can only be induced in the geometric
    median if at least half of the points are from adversarial agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, the geometric median cannot be directly computed, instead
    relying on numerical approximations or iterative algorithms to
    compute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To compute the geometric mean iteratively, Weiszfeld's algorithm can
    be used as follows:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def geometric_median_aggregate(parameter_vectors, epsilon):</p>
<p>vector_shape = parameter_vectors[0].shape</p>
<p>vector_buffer = list(v.flatten() for v in parameter_vectors)</p>
<p>prev_median = np.zeros(vector_buffer[0].shape)</p>
<p>delta = np.inf</p>
<p>vector_matrix = np.vstack(vector_buffer)</p>
<p>while (delta &gt; epsilon):</p>
<p>dists = np.sqrt(np.sum((vector_matrix -
prev_median[np.newaxis, :])**2, axis=1))</p>
<p>curr_median = np.sum(vector_matrix / dists[:, np.newaxis],
axis=0) / np.sum(1 / dists)</p>
<p>delta = np.linalg.norm(curr_median - prev_median)</p>
<p>prev_median = curr_median</p>
<p>return prev_median.reshape(vector_shape)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>This algorithm uses the fact that the geometric median of a set of
    points is the point that minimizes the sum of Euclidean distances
    over the set, performing a form of weighted least squares
    with weights inversely proportional to the Euclidean distance
    between the point and the current median estimate at each iteration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aggregation using the coordinate-wise median</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The coordinate-wise median is constructed by taking the median of
    each coordinate across the sample, as the name suggests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This median can be directly computed, unlike the geometric median,
    and intuitively offers similar robustness to outliers due to the
    properties of the median in univariate statistics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, it is unclear whether the resulting model displays any
    theoretical similarities to the arithmetic mean in regard to
    performance on the dataset and convergence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NumPy makes the implementation of this function quite simple, as
    follows:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>def coordinate_median_aggregate(parameter_vectors):</strong></p>
<p>**    return np.median(parameter_vectors, axis=0)**</p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>It is clear that the coordinate-wise median is far more
    computationally efficient to compute than the geometric median,
    trading off theoretical guarantees for speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aggregation using the Krum algorithm</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An alternative approach is to isolate outlier points from
    adversarial agents prior to aggregation. The most well-known example
    of this approach is the <strong>Krum algorithm</strong>, where distance-based
    scoring is performed prior to aggregation as a means of
    locating outlier points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifically, the Krum algorithm first computes the pairwise L2
    distance between each point -- these distances are then used to
    compute a score for each point equal to the sum of
    the <em>n-f-2</em> smallest L2 distances (<em>f</em> is a parameter that is set).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, Krum outputs the received point with the lowest score,
    effectively returning the point with a minimal total L2 distance
    with <em>f</em> outlier points that are ignored. Alternatively, the scoring
    approach used by Krum can be used to trim outlier points prior to
    the computation of the arithmetic mean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In both cases, for sufficiently large <em>n</em> and <em>2f+2 \&lt; n</em>,
    convergence rates similar to those of FedAvg in the non-adversarial
    case are achieved. More information on the Krum algorithm can be
    found in the original paper, which is
    located at <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/hash/f4b9ec30ad9f68f89b29639786cb62ef-Abstract.html">https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/hash/f4b9ec30ad9f68f89b29639786cb62ef-Abstract.html</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Krum algorithm can be used to perform aggregation as follows:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def krum_aggregate(parameter_vectors, f, use_mean=False):</p>
<p>num_vectors = len(parameter_vectors)</p>
<p>filtered_size = max(1, num_vectors-f-2)</p>
<p>scores = np.zeros(num_vectors)</p>
<p>for i in range(num_vectors):</p>
<p>distances = np.zeros(num_vectors)</p>
<p>for j in range(num_vectors):</p>
<p>distances[j] = np.linalg.norm(parameter_vectors[i] -
parameter_vectors[j])</p>
<p>scores[i] = np.sum(np.sort(distances)[:filtered_size])</p>
<p>if (use_mean):</p>
<p>idx = np.argsort(scores)[:filtered_size]</p>
<p>return np.mean(np.stack(parameter_vectors)[idx], axis=0)</p>
<p>else:</p>
<p>idx = np.argmin(scores)</p>
<p>return parameter_vectors[idx]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that a flag has been included to determine which of the two
    Krum aggregation approaches (single selection versus trimmed mean)
    should be used. Vectorizing the distance computation is possible,
    but the iterative approach was preferred due to the expectation of
    large parameter vectors and smaller agent counts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-IID datasets</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The theoretical underpinning granted to FL by working with IID
    datasets plays a significant role in allowing performant aggregate
    models to be achieved through FL. At a high level, this can be
    explained by the discrepancy between the learning done by models in
    different datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No theoretical guarantees can be made for the convergence of such
    models when dataset-agnostic aggregation methods are applied --
    unless constraints on the non-IID nature of the datasets are
    applied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key hindering factor is the high probability of local models
    moving toward non-shared optima in the parameter space, leading to
    consistent drift between the local models and the aggregate model
    after each local training phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are methods that attempt to restrict the modifications made to
    the aggregate model based on the local machine learning task,
    relying on the overparameterization of deep learning models to find
    relatively disjointed parameter subsets to optimize the aggregate
    model of each task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One such aggregation approach is <strong>FedCurv</strong>, which uses the Fisher
    information matrix of the previous aggregate model to act as a
    regulator for auxiliary parameter modifications during local
    training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, the robustness of this approach for extreme non-IID cases
    in practical applications likely needs to be tested further
    to ensure acceptable performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implementing FedCurv</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The implementation of FedCurv involves two key modifications to the
    standard FedAvg approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, the local loss function must be modified to include the
    regularization term incorporating the aggregated Fisher information
    from the previous round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, the Fisher information matrix of the parameters must be
    calculated and aggregated correctly for use in the next round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The local training example code, as shown in the <em>Implementing
    FedProx</em> section, will be used again to demonstrate an
    implementation of FedCurv.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earlier, we saw that a model conversion layer allows for
    framework-agnostic model representations to be operated on by the
    aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previously, these representations only contained the respective
    parameters from the original models; however, this agnostic
    representation actually allows for any desired parameter to be
    aggregated, even those only loosely tied to the true model
    parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means that the secondary parameters can be bundled and sent
    with the local model, aggregated, and then separated from the
    aggregate model in the next round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In FedCurv, there are two sets of parameters that must be computed
    locally and aggregated for use in the next round; therefore, it can
    be assumed that these parameters are sent with the local model after
    training and separated from the aggregate model before training, for
    the sake of brevity in the example code (the implementation of this
    functionality is straightforward).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result, the two key modifications for FedCurv, as mentioned
    earlier, can be simplified down into computing the Fisher
    information parameters after locally training the model and
    computing the regularization term with the received aggregate
    Fisher information parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Fisher information matrix refers to the covariance of the
    gradient of the log-likelihood function of a model with respect to
    its parameters, often empirically evaluated over the data present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FedCurv only utilizes the diagonal entries of this matrix, the
    variances between the gradient parameters, and their expected
    values of zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a high level, this variance term can be considered an estimate of
    how influential the parameter is in changing the performance of the
    model on the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This information is essential for preventing the modification of
    parameters key to good performance on one dataset during the local
    training of other agents -- the underlying idea behind FedCurv.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relaxing the measure of model performance from the gradient of the
    log-likelihood to the gradient of any objective function allows for
    the direct use of the gradient terms computed during backpropagation
    when computing the variance terms for models using gradient-based
    optimization methods, such as deep learning models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifically, the variance term of a parameter is equal to the
    square of its respective gradient term, allowing for the terms to be
    directly computed from the net gradients calculated during local
    training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, we create two variables to store the agent's most recent
    Fisher information parameters and the received aggregate Fisher
    information parameters, which are used to determine the Fisher
    information from the other agents. The value of the lambda parameter
    of FedCurv is fixed, and total_grad is initialized as a container
    for the cumulative gradient from each training loop:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>agg_model = ... # Get aggregated model from aggregator</p>
<p>model.load_state_dict(agg_model.state_dict())</p>
<p>fisher_info_params = ... # Initialize at start, then maintain to
store past round parameters</p>
<p>agg_fisher_info_params = ... # Separate aggregate Fisher information
parameters from aggregate model parameters</p>
<p># Only consider other agents, and convert to PyTorch tensor</p>
<p>agg_fisher_info_params = {k:torch.tensor(agg_fisher_info_params[k] -
fisher_info_params[k]) for k in fisher_info_params.keys()}</p>
<p># Scaling parameter for FedCurv regularization term</p>
<p>fedcurv_lambda = 1.0</p>
<p>total_grad = {i:torch.zeros_like(param.data) for i,param in
enumerate(model.parameters())}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Then, we compute the FedCurv regularization term from the model
    weights and the aggregate Fisher information parameters. This term
    is weighted by lambda and added to the loss term before
    computing the gradients:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>model.train()</p>
<p>for epoch in range(num_epochs):</p>
<p>for batch_idx, (inputs, targets) in enumerate(trainloader):</p>
<p>inputs, targets = inputs.to(device), targets.to(device)</p>
<p>optimizer.zero_grad()</p>
<p>outputs = model(inputs)</p>
<p>loss = criterion(outputs, targets)</p>
<p>for i,param in enumerate(model.parameters()):</p>
<p># Factor out regularization term to use saved fisher info
parameters</p>
<p>reg_term = (param.data ** 2) *
agg_fisher_info_params[f\'fedcurv_u_{i}\']</p>
<p>reg_term += 2 * param.data *
agg_fisher_info_params[f\'fedcurv_v_{i}\']</p>
<p>reg_term += (agg_fisher_info_params[f\'fedcurv_v_{i}\']
** 2) / agg_fisher_info_params[f\'fedcurv_u_{i}\']</p>
<p>loss += fedcurv_lambda * reg_term.sum()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The gradients are then computed and stored in total_grad before
    updating the model weights:</li>
</ul>
<p>loss.backward()</p>
<p>for i,param in enumerate(model.parameters()):</p>
<p>total_grad[i] += param.grad</p>
<p>optimizer.step()</p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we compute and store the agent's most recent Fisher
    information parameters for use in the next round:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>for i,param in enumerate(model.parameters()):</p>
<p>fisher_info_params[f\'fedcurv_u_{i}\'] = (total_grad[i] **
2).numpy()</p>
<p>fisher_info_params[f\'fedcurv_v_{i}\'] = ((total_grad[i] **
2) * param.data).numpy()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, framework-agnostic aggregation can be used to implement
    FedCurv on top of FedAvg. The full FL example using FedCurv can be
    found at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Federated-Learning-with-Python/tree/main/ch7/agg_fl_examples/cifar_fedcurv_example">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Federated-Learning-with-Python/tree/main/ch7/agg_fl_examples/cifar_fedcurv_example</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data-sharing approach</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To make further progress, changes to external aspects of the FL
    scenario are necessary. For example, let's assume that the data
    privacy restriction is loosened, such that small subsets of the
    local datasets from each agent can be shared with the other agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This data-sharing approach allows for homogeneity in the local data
    distributions proportional to the amount of shared data to be
    achieved, at the expense of the key stationary data property of FL
    that makes it desirable in many privacy-oriented applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, data-sharing approaches are generally unsuitable for the
    majority of applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Personalization through fine-tuning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is clear that producing a single model that demonstrates strong
    performance across the local datasets is not easy when the datasets
    are IID. However, what would happen if the single model restriction
    was removed from the FL process?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the goal is to produce local models that perform well on the same
    edge devices where training is conducted, removing the single model
    restriction allows for the use of different local models that have
    been trained on the exact data distributions where inference
    is being applied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This concept is called <em>personalization</em>, in which agents use
    versions of the aggregate model tuned for the local data
    distribution to achieve strong performance. The key point of this
    approach is to balance the local performance of the locally trained
    model with the global performance and the resulting robustness of
    the aggregate model received in each round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One method of accomplishing this is for each agent to maintain their
    local models across the rounds, updating the local model with the
    weighted average of the previous local model and the received
    aggregate model during each round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, consider a relaxation that allows for multiple
    aggregate models to be produced in each round. In cases where the
    local data distributions can be clustered into just a few separated
    groups, distribution-aware aggregation would allow for the selective
    application of aggregation methods to groups of models belonging to
    the same distribution cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One example of this approach is the <strong>Performance-Based Neighbor
    Selection</strong> (<strong>PENS</strong>) algorithm, where agents receive locally
    trained models from other agents and test them on their own local
    dataset during the first phase. Using the assumption that models
    trained on similar datasets will perform better than models trained
    on different datasets, the agents then determine the set of other
    agents with similar data distributions, allowing for aggregation to
    only be performed with similar agents in the second phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A second approach is to <em>add an intermediate aggregation</em> step
    between the local models and the global aggregate model called a
    cluster model. By leveraging knowledge about the agent data
    distributions or through a dynamic allocation method, agents with
    similar data distributions can be assigned to a cluster aggregator,
    which is then known to produce a strong model due to its agents
    having IID datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balancing the performance of the cluster models with the robustness
    of global aggregation leads to the concept of the semi-global model,
    in which subsamples of the cluster models can be selected
    (potentially based on data distribution) to create a smaller set of
    partially global aggregate models that maintain performance and
    robustness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the cluster and semi-global model approach is beneficial
    for both aggregation and achieving a fully distributed FL system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The goal of This section was to provide a conceptual overview of the
    current knowledge of aggregation, the key theoretical step in FL
    that allows for the disjoint training done by each agent to be
    pooled together with minimal transmission required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FedAvg is a simple, yet surprisingly powerful aggregation algorithm
    that performs well in an ideal FL scenario. This scenario is
    achieved when training is done across IID datasets using machines
    with similar levels of computational power and no adversarial or
    otherwise incorrectly performing agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unfortunately, these conditions are often not met when deploying an
    FL system in the real world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To address these cases, we introduced and implemented modified
    aggregation approaches: FedProx, FedCurv, and three different robust
    mean estimators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After reading This section, you should have a solid understanding of
    the considerations that must be taken into account for practical FL
    applications, and you should be able to integrate the aforementioned
    algorithms into these applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next section, we will do a deep dive into some of the
    existing FL frameworks with several toy examples to demonstrate the
    functionalities provided by each.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Introducing Existing Federated Learning Frameworks</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The objective of This section is to introduce existing <strong>federated
    learning</strong> (<strong>FL</strong>) frameworks and platforms, applying each to
    federated learning scenarios involving toy <strong>machine
    learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>) problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The platforms focused on Here are Flower, TensorFlow Federated,
    OpenFL, IBM FL, and STADLE -- the idea behind this selection was to
    help you by covering a breadth of existing FL platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the end of This section, you should have a basic understanding of
    how to use each platform for FL, and you should be able to choose a
    platform based on its associated strengths and weaknesses for an FL
    application.</p>

</ul>
<p>Introduction to FL frameworks</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we introduce the FL frameworks and platforms to be used in
    the subsequent implementation-focused sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flower</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Flower (<a href="https://flower.dev/">[https://flower.dev/]{.underline}</a>)
    is an open source and ML framework-agnostic FL framework that aims
    to be accessible to users. Flower follows a standard client-server
    architecture, in which the clients are set up to receive the model
    parameters from the server, train on local data, and send the new
    local model parameters back to the server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The high-level orchestration of the federated learning process is
    dictated by what Flower calls strategies, used by the server for
    aspects such as client selection and parameter aggregation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flower uses <strong>Remote Procedure Calls</strong> (<strong>RPCs</strong>) in order to
    perform said orchestration through client-side execution from
    messages sent by the server. The extensibility of the framework
    allows researchers to experiment with novel approaches such as new
    aggregation algorithms and communication methods (such as model
    compression).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TensorFlow Federated (TFF)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TFF
    (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/federated">[https://www.tensorflow.org/federated]{.underline}</a>)
    is an open source FL/computation framework built on top of
    TensorFlow that aims to allow researchers to easily simulate
    federated learning with existing TensorFlow/Keras models and
    training pipelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It consists of the Federated Core layer, which allows for the
    implementation of general federated computations, and the Federated
    Learning layer, which is built on top and provides interfaces
    for FL-specific processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TFF focuses on single-machine local simulations of FL, using
    wrappers to create TFF-specific datasets, models, and federated
    computations (core client and server computation performed during
    the FL process) from the standard TensorFlow equivalents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The focus on building everything from general federated computations
    allows researchers to implement each step as desired, allowing
    experimentation to be supported.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenFL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>OpenFL
    (<a href="https://github.com/intel/openfl">[https://github.com/intel/openfl]{.underline}</a>)
    is an open source FL framework developed by Intel, focused on
    allowing cross-silo privacy-preserving ML to be performed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenFL allows for two different workflows depending on the desired
    lifespan of the federation (where federation refers to the entire FL
    system).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the aggregator-based workflow, a single experiment and associated
    federated learning plan are sent from the aggregator to the
    participating <em>collaborators</em> (agents) to be run as the local
    training step of the FL process---the federation is stopped after
    the experiment is complete. In the director-based workflow,
    long-lived components are instead used to allow for experiments to
    be run on demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following diagram depicts the architecture and users for the
    director-based workflow:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/media/image69.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"

<p>Figure 8.1 -- Architecture of director-based workflow (adapted from
https://openfl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/openfl/components.html)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Director Manager</strong> oversees the running of experiments, working
    with long-lived <strong>Envoy</strong> components residing on the collaborator
    nodes to manage the short-lived components (collaborators +
    aggregator) for each experiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In targeting the cross-silo data scenario, OpenFL applies a unique
    focus on managing data shards, including cases where data
    representations differ across silos.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IBM FL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IBM FL is a framework that also focuses on enterprise FL. It follows
    a straightforward aggregator-party design, where some number of
    parties with local data collaborate with other parties by sending
    incremental model training results to the aggregator and working
    with the produced aggregate models (following standard client-server
    FL architecture).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IBM FL has official support for a number of fusion (aggregation)
    algorithms and certain fairness techniques aimed at combating
    bias---the details of these algorithms can be found at the
    repository located at https://github.com/IBM/federated-learning-lib.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One specific goal of IBM FL is to be highly extensible,
    allowing users to easily make necessary modifications if specific
    features are desired. It also supports a Jupyter-Notebook-based
    dashboard to aid in orchestrating FL experiments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>STADLE</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unlike the previous frameworks, STADLE
    (<a href="https://stadle.ai/">[https://stadle.ai/]{.underline}</a>) is
    an ML-framework-agnostic FL and distributed learning SaaS platform
    that aims to allow for the seamless integration of FL into
    production-ready applications and ML pipelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal of STADLE is to minimize the amount of FL-specific code
    necessary for integration, making FL accessible to newcomers while
    still providing flexibility to those looking to experiment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the STADLE SaaS platform, users of varying technical abilities
    can collaborate on FL projects at all scales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance tracking and model management functionalities allow
    users to produce validated federated models with strong performance,
    while an intuitive configuration panel allows for detailed control
    over the federated learning process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>STADLE uses a two-level component hierarchy that allows for multiple
    aggregators to operate in parallel, scaling to match demand. The
    following figure depicts the high-level architecture:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 8.2 -- STADLE multi-aggregator architecture

<p>Figure 8.2 -- STADLE multi-aggregator architecture</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of STADLE clients is streamlined with pip installation
    and an easy-to-understand configuration file, with several examples
    made publicly available for use as a reference on the different ways
    STADLE can be integrated into existing ML code.</li>
</ul>
<p>PySyft</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While PySyft
    (<a href="https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft">[https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft]{.underline}</a>)
    implementations are not included in this section due to ongoing
    changes in the codebase, it is still a major player in the
    privacy-preserving deep learning space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The core principle behind PySyft is to allow for the ability to
    perform computations over data stored on a machine without direct
    access to said data ever being given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is accomplished by adding an intermediate layer between the
    user and the data location that sends computation requests to
    participating worker machines, returning the computed result to the
    user while maintaining the privacy of the data stored and used by
    each worker to perform the computation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This general capability directly extends itself to FL, reworking
    each step of a normal deep learning training flow to be a
    computation over the model parameters and data stored at each worker
    (agent) participating in FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To accomplish this, PySyft utilizes hooks that encapsulate the
    standard PyTorch/TensorFlow libraries, modifying the requisite
    internal functions in order to allow model training and testing to
    be supported as PySyft privacy-preserving computations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that the high-level ideas behind the FL frameworks have been
    explained, we move to the implementation-level details for their
    practical usage in two example scenarios. First, we look at how to
    modify the existing centralized training code for an NLP model
    to use FL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example -- the federated training of an NLP model</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first ML problem that will be converted into an FL scenario
    through each of the aforementioned FL frameworks will be a
    classification problem within the domain of NLP.</p>

<li>
<p>At a high level, NLP refers to the intersection of computational
    linguistics and ML with an overarching goal of allowing computers to
    achieve some level of <em>understanding</em> from human language -- the
    details of this understanding vary widely based on the specific
    problem being targeted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For this example, we will be performing sentiment analysis on movie
    reviews, classifying them as positive or negative. The dataset we
    will be using is the SST-2 dataset
    (https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/), containing movie reviews in a
    string format and the associated binary labels 0/1 representing
    negative and positive sentiment, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The model we will use to perform binary classification is a
    pretrained BERT model with a custom classification head.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BERT model allows us to encode a sentence into a
    high-dimensional numerical vector, which can then be passed to the
    classification head to output the binary label prediction; more
    information on the BERT model can be found at
    https://huggingface.co/blog/bert-101.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We choose to use a pretrained model that has already learned how to
    produce general encodings for sentences after a significant amount
    of training, as opposed to performing said training from scratch.
    This allows us to focus training on the classification head to
    fine-tune the model on the SST-2 dataset, saving time
    while maintaining performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will now go through the local (centralized) training code that
    will be used as a base when showing how to use each of the FL
    frameworks, starting with the Keras model definition and dataset
    loader.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Defining the sentiment analysis model</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The SSTModel object defined in the sst_model.py file is the Keras
    model we will be using for this example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, we import the requisite libraries:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>from tensorflow import keras</p>
<p>from keras import layers</p>
<p>import tensorflow_text</p>
<p>import tensorflow_hub as hub</p>
<p>import tensorflow_datasets as tfds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TensorFlow Hub is used to easily download the pretrained BERT
    weights into a Keras layer. TensorFlow Text is used when loading in
    the BERT weights from TensorFlow Hub. TensorFlow Datasets will allow
    us to download and cache the SST-2 dataset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, we define the model and initialize the model layer objects:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>class SSTModel(keras.Model):</p>
<p>def __init__(self):</p>
<p>super(SSTModel, self).__init__()</p>
<p>self.preprocessor =
hub.KerasLayer(\"https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_preprocess/3\")</p>
<p>self.small_bert =
hub.KerasLayer(\"https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/4\")</p>
<p>self.small_bert.trainable = False</p>
<p>self.fc1 = layers.Dense(512, activation=\'relu\')</p>
<p>self.fc2 = layers.Dense(64, activation=\'relu\')</p>
<p>self.fc3 = layers.Dense(1, activation=\'sigmoid\')</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The preprocessor object takes the raw sentence input batches and
    converts them into the format used by the BERT model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We load the preprocessor and BERT layers from TensorFlow Hub, then
    initialize the dense layers that make up the classification head. We
    use the sigmoid activation function at the end to squash the output
    into the interval (0,1), allowing for comparison with the true
    labels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can then define the forward pass of the model:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def call(self, inputs):</p>
<p>input_dict = self.preprocessor(inputs)</p>
<p>bert_output = self.small_bert(input_dict)[\'pooled_output\']</p>
<p>output = self.fc1(keras.activations.relu(bert_output,
alpha=0.2))</p>
<p>scores = self.fc3(self.fc2(output))</p>
<p>return scores</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We apply leaky ReLU to the BERT output to add non-linearity before
    passing the output to the classification head layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating the data loader</p>
<ul>
<li>We also implement a function to load in the SST-2 dataset using the
    TensorFlow Datasets library. First, the training data is loaded and
    converted into a NumPy array for use during training:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def load_sst_data(client_idx=None, num_clients=1):</p>
<p>x_train = []</p>
<p>y_train = []</p>
<p>for d in tfds.load(name=\"glue/sst2\", split=\"train\"):</p>
<p>x_train.append(d[\'sentence\'].numpy())</p>
<p>y_train.append(d[\'label\'].numpy())</p>
<p>x_train = np.array(x_train)</p>
<p>y_train = np.array(y_train)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We load the test data in a similar manner:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>x_test = []</p>
<p>y_test = []</p>
<p>for d in tfds.load(name=\"glue/sst2\", split=\"validation\"):</p>
<p>x_test.append(d[\'sentence\'].numpy())</p>
<p>y_test.append(d[\'label\'].numpy())</p>
<p>x_test = np.array(x_test)</p>
<p>y_test = np.array(y_test)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>If client_idx and num_clients are specified, we return the
    respective partition of the training dataset -- this will be used
    for performing FL:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>if (client_idx is not None):</p>
<p>shard_size = int(x_train.size / num_clients)</p>
<p>x_train =
x_train[client_idx*shard_size:(client_idx+1)*shard_size]</p>
<p>y_train =
x_train[client_idx*shard_size:(client_idx+1)*shard_size]</p>
<p>return (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, we examine the code to perform local training,
    located in local_training.py.</li>
</ul>
<p>Training the model</p>
<ul>
<li>We first import the requisite libraries:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>from tensorflow import keras</p>
<p>from sst_model import SSTModel, load_sst_data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We can then use the previously defined dataset loader (without
    splitting) to load in the train and test splits:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(x_train,y_train), (x_test,y_test) = load_sst_data()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We can now compile the model and begin training:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>model.compile(</p>
<p>optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.0005,
amsgrad=False),</p>
<p>loss = keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(),</p>
<p>metrics = [keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy()]</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=64, epochs=3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we evaluate the model on the test split:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>_, acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=64)</p>
<p>print(f\"Accuracy of model on test set: {(100*acc):.2f}%\")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The model should reach around 82% test accuracy after three
    epochs of training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we have gone through the local training code, we can
    examine how the code can be modified to use FL with each of the
    aforementioned FL frameworks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adopting an FL training approach</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To demonstrate how FL can be applied to the SST model training
    scenario, we have to first split the original SST-2 dataset into
    disjoint subsets representing the local datasets in an FL
    application. To keep things simple, we will examine the case of
    three agents each training on separate thirds of the dataset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For now, these subsets are randomly sampled without replacement from
    the dataset -- in the next section, <em>Federated training of an image
    classification model on non-IID data</em>, we examine the case where the
    local datasets are created from a biased sampling of the original
    dataset. Instead of locally training for three epochs, we will
    perform three rounds of FL with each local training phase training
    for one epoch on the local data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FedAvg will be used to aggregate the locally trained models at the
    end of each round. After these three rounds, the aforementioned
    validation metrics will be computed using the final aggregate model,
    allowing for comparisons to be drawn between the local training
    cases and the FL case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Integrating TensorFlow Federated for SST-2</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As previously mentioned, the <strong>TensorFlow Federated</strong> (<strong>TFF</strong>)
    framework was built on top of the TensorFlow and Keras deep
    learning libraries. The model implementation was done using Keras;
    as a result, the integration of TFF into the local training code
    is relatively straightforward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first step is to add the TFF-specific imports and FL-specific
    parameters prior to loading the dataset:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>import nest_asyncio</p>
<p>nest_asyncio.apply()</p>
<p>import tensorflow_federated as tff</p>
<p>NUM_CLIENTS = 3</p>
<p>NUM_ROUNDS = 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>TFF allows us to simulate some number of agents by passing the
    appropriate number of datasets (local datasets) to the FL process.
    To split the SST-2 dataset into thirds after preprocessing, we can
    use the following code:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>client_datasets = [load_sst_data(idx, NUM_CLIENTS)[0] for idx in
range(NUM_CLIENTS)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, we have to wrap the Keras model using a TFF API function to
    easily create the respective tff.learning.Model object. We create a
    function that initializes the SST model and passes it along with the
    input spec (information on the size of each data element) to this
    API function, returning the result -- TFF will use this function
    internally to create the model during the FL process:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def sst_model_fn():</p>
<p>sst_model = SSTModel()</p>
<p>sst_model.build(input_shape=(None,64))</p>
<p>return tff.learning.from_keras_model(</p>
<p>sst_model,</p>
<p>input_spec=tf.TensorSpec(shape=(None), dtype=tf.string),</p>
<p>loss=keras.metrics.BinaryCrossentropy()</p>
<p>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The TFF FedAvg process can then be created, using
    the sst_model_fn function along with the optimizers used to update
    the local models and the aggregate model. Using a learning rate of
    1.0 for the server optimizer function allows for the new aggregate
    model to replace the old one at the end of each round (as opposed to
    computing a weighted average of the old and new models):</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>fed_avg_process = tff.learning.algorithms.build_unweighted_fed_avg(</p>
<p>model_fn = sst_model_fn,</p>
<p>client_optimizer_fn = lambda:
keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),</p>
<p>server_optimizer_fn = lambda:
keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=1.0)</p>
<p>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we initialize and run the federated learning process for 10
    rounds. Each fed_avg_process.next() call simulates one round by
    performing local training with three models on the client datasets
    followed by aggregation using FedAvg. The resulting state after the
    first round is passed to the next call as the starting FL state
    for the round:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>state = fed_avg_process.initialize()</p>
<p>for round in range(NUM_ROUNDS):</p>
<p>state = fed_avg_process.next(state, client_datasets).state</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>After the FL process is completed, we convert the final
    aggregate tff.learning.Model object back into the original Keras
    model format in order to compute the validation metrics:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>fed_weights = fed_avg_process.get_model_weights(state)</p>
<p>fed_sst_model = SSTModel()</p>
<p>fed_sst_model.build(input_shape=(None, 64))</p>
<p>fed_sst_model.compile(</p>
<p>optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.005,
amsgrad=False),</p>
<p>loss = keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(),</p>
<p>metrics = [keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy()]</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>fed_weights.assign_weights_to(fed_sst_model)</p>
<p>_, (x_test, y_test) = load_sst_data()</p>
<p>_, acc = fed_sst_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=64)</p>
<p>print(f\"Accuracy of federated model on test set: {(100*acc):.2f}%\")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The final accuracy of the aggregate model should be around 82%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From this, it should be clear that the TFF FedAvg results are nearly
    identical to those of the local training scenario.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Integrating OpenFL for SST-2</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recall that OpenFL supports two different workflows: the
    aggregator-based workflow and the director-based workflow. This
    example will use the director-based workflow, involving long-living
    components that can conduct FL task requests as they come in. This
    was chosen due to the desirability of having a persistent FL setup
    for deploying multiple projects; however, both workflows conduct the
    same core FL process and thus demonstrate similar performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help with model serialization in this case, we only aggregate the
    classification head weights, reconstructing the full model at
    runtime during training and validation (TensorFlow Hub caches the
    downloaded layers, so the download process only occurs once). We
    include the following functions in sst_model.py to aid with this
    modification:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def get_sst_full(preprocessor, bert, classification_head):</p>
<p>sst_input = keras.Input(shape=(), batch_size=64, dtype=tf.string)</p>
<p>scores =
classification_head(bert(preprocessor(sst_input))[\'pooled_output\'])</p>
<p>return keras.Model(inputs=sst_input, outputs=scores,
name=\'sst_model\')</p>
<p>def get_classification_head():</p>
<p>classification_head = keras.Sequential([</p>
<p>layers.Dense(512, activation=\'relu\', input_shape=(768,)),</p>
<p>layers.Dense(64, activation=\'relu\', input_shape=(512,)),</p>
<p>layers.Dense(1, activation=\'sigmoid\', input_shape=(64,))</p>
<p>])</p>
<p>return classification_head</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because OpenFL focuses on addressing the data silo case, the
    creation of the local datasets from the SST-2 data is slightly more
    involved than the TFF case. The objects needed to create the dataset
    will be implemented in a separate file named sst_fl_dataset.py.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, we include the necessary imports. The two OpenFL-specific
    objects we import are the ShardDescriptor object, which handles the
    dataset loading and sharding, and the DataInterface object,
    which handles access to the datasets:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>from openfl.interface.interactive_api.shard_descriptor import
ShardDescriptor</p>
<p>from openfl.interface.interactive_api.experiment import DataInterface</p>
<p>import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>from sst_model import load_sst_data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<p><strong>Implementing ShardDescriptor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We first implement the SSTShardDescriptor class. When this shard
    descriptor is created, we save the rank (client number)
    and worldsize (total number of clients) values, then load the
    training and validation datasets:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>class SSTShardDescriptor(ShardDescriptor):</p>
<p>def __init__(</p>
<p>self,</p>
<p>rank_worldsize: str = \'1, 1\',</p>
<p>**kwargs</p>
<p>):</p>
<p>self.rank, self.worldsize = tuple(int(num) for num in
rank_worldsize.split(\',\'))</p>
<p>(x_train,y_train), (x_test,y_test) =
load_sst_data(self.rank-1, self.worldsize)</p>
<p>self.data_by_type = {</p>
<p>\'train\': tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_train,
y_train)).batch(64),</p>
<p>\'val\': tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((x_test,
y_test)).batch(64)</p>
<p>}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We implement the ShardDescriptor class functions to get the
    available dataset types (training and validation in this case) and
    the respective dataset/shard based on the rank of the client:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def get_shard_dataset_types(self):</p>
<p>return list(self.data_by_type)</p>
<p>def get_dataset(self, dataset_type=\'train\'):</p>
<p>if dataset_type not in self.data_by_type:</p>
<p>raise Exception(f\'Wrong dataset type: {dataset_type}\')</p>
<p>return self.data_by_type[dataset_type]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We also specify the properties of the specific dataset being used.
    Note that the sample shape is set to 1. The preprocessor layer of
    the SSTModel allows us to pass in strings as input, which are
    treated as input vectors of type tf.string and length 1:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>@property</p>
<p>def sample_shape(self):</p>
<p>return [\"1\"]</p>
<p>@property</p>
<p>def target_shape(self):</p>
<p>return [\"1\"]</p>
<p>@property</p>
<p>def dataset_description(self) -&gt; str:</p>
<p>return (f\'SST dataset, shard number {self.rank}\'</p>
<p>f\' out of {self.worldsize}\')</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>With this, the SSTShardDescriptor implementation is completed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implementing DataInterface</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, we implement the SSTFedDataset class as a subclass
    of DataInterface. This is done by implementing the shard descriptor
    getter and setter methods, with the setter method preparing the data
    to be provided to the training/validation FL tasks:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>class SSTFedDataset(DataInterface):</p>
<p>def __init__(self, **kwargs):</p>
<p>super().__init__(**kwargs)</p>
<p>@property</p>
<p>def shard_descriptor(self):</p>
<p>return self._shard_descriptor</p>
<p>@shard_descriptor.setter</p>
<p>def shard_descriptor(self, shard_descriptor):</p>
<p>self._shard_descriptor = shard_descriptor</p>
<p>self.train_set = shard_descriptor.get_dataset(\'train\')</p>
<p>self.valid_set = shard_descriptor.get_dataset(\'val\')</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We also implement the API functions to grant dataset access and
    dataset size information (used during aggregation):</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def get_train_loader(self):</p>
<p>return self.train_set</p>
<p>def get_valid_loader(self):</p>
<p>return self.valid_set</p>
<p>def get_train_data_size(self):</p>
<p>return len(self.train_set) * 64</p>
<p>def get_valid_data_size(self):</p>
<p>return len(self.valid_set) * 64</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>With this, the local SST-2 datasets can be constructed and used.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Creating FLExperiment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We now focus on the actual implementation of the FL process within a
    new file, fl_sim.py. First, we import the necessary libraries --
    from OpenFL, we import the following:</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-43-1" name="__codelineno-43-1" href="#__codelineno-43-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   TaskInterface: Allows us to define our FL training and validation
    tasks for the model; the registered tasks are what the director
    instructs each envoy to conduct</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ModelInterface: Allows us to convert our Keras model into the format
    used by OpenFL in the registered tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federation: Manages information relating to the connection with the
    director</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FLExperiment: Uses the TaskInterface, ModelInterface,
    and Federation objects to conduct the FL process</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-44-1" name="__codelineno-44-1" href="#__codelineno-44-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   The requisite imports are done as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>from tensorflow import keras</p>
<p>import tensorflow_hub as hub</p>
<p>from openfl.interface.interactive_api.experiment import TaskInterface</p>
<p>from openfl.interface.interactive_api.experiment import ModelInterface</p>
<p>from openfl.interface.interactive_api.experiment import FLExperiment</p>
<p>from openfl.interface.interactive_api.federation import Federation</p>
<p>from sst_model import get_classification_head, get_sst_full</p>
<p>from sst_fl_dataset import SSTFedDataset</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, we create the Federation object using the
    default director connection information:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>client_id = \'api\'</p>
<p>director_node_fqdn = \'localhost\'</p>
<p>director_port = 50051</p>
<p>federation = Federation(</p>
<p>client_id=client_id,</p>
<p>director_node_fqdn=director_node_fqdn,</p>
<p>director_port=director_port,</p>
<p>tls=False</p>
<p>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We then initialize the model with the associated optimizer and loss
    function -- these objects are used by the OpenFL KerasAdapter to
    create the ModelInterface object. We call the model on a dummy Keras
    input in order to initialize all of the weights before passing the
    model to ModelInterface:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>classification_head = get_classification_head()</p>
<p>optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.005, amsgrad=False)</p>
<p>loss = keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()</p>
<p>framework_adapter =
\'openfl.plugins.frameworks_adapters.keras_adapter.FrameworkAdapterPlugin\'</p>
<p>MI = ModelInterface(model=classification_head, optimizer=optimizer,
framework_plugin=framework_adapter)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, we create a TaskInterface object and use it to register the
    training task. Note that including the optimizer in the decorator
    function of a task will result in the training dataset being passed
    to the task; otherwise, the validation dataset will be passed to the
    task:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>TI = TaskInterface()</p>
<p>\@TI.register_fl_task(model=\'model\', data_loader=\'train_data\',

<li>Similarly, we register the validation task using

<li>We can now load in the dataset using the SSTFedDataset class

</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<p><strong>Defining the configuration files</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The last step is to create the configuration files used
    by director and envoys in order to actually load the data and start
    the FL process. First, we create director_config containing
    the following information:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>settings:</p>
<p>listen_host: localhost</p>
<p>listen_port: 50051</p>
<p>sample_shape: [\"1\"]</p>
<p>target_shape: [\"1\"]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is saved in director/director_config.yaml.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then create the three envoy configuration files. The first file
    (envoy_config_1.yaml) contains the following:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>params:</p>
<p>cuda_devices: []</p>
<p>optional_plugin_components: {}</p>
<p>shard_descriptor:</p>
<p>template: sst_fl_dataset.SSTShardDescriptor</p>
<p>params:</p>
<p>rank_worldsize: 1, 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The second and third envoy config files are the same, except with
    the values rank_worldsize: 2, 3 and rank_worldsize: 3, 3,
    respectively. These config files, alongside all of the code files,
    are stored in the experiment directory. The directory structure
    should look like the following:</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-45-1" name="__codelineno-45-1" href="#__codelineno-45-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;

<li>

<li>
<p>envoy_config_1.yaml</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>envoy_config_2.yaml</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>envoy_config_3.yaml</p>

</code></pre></div>
-   With everything set up, we can now perform FL with OpenFL.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Running the OpenFL example</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, start the director by running the following command from
    within the director folder (make sure OpenFL is installed in
    the working environment):</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>fx director start --disable-tls -c director_config.yaml</p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, run the following commands in separate terminals from
    the experiment directory:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>fx envoy start -n envoy_1 ---disable-tls --envoy-config-path
envoy_config_1.yaml -dh localhost -dp 50051</p>
<p>fx envoy start -n envoy_2 ---disable-tls --envoy-config-path
envoy_config_2.yaml -dh localhost -dp 50051</p>
<p>fx envoy start -n envoy_3 ---disable-tls --envoy-config-path
envoy_config_3.yaml -dh localhost -dp 50051</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, start FLExperiment by running the fl_sim.py script. After
    the three rounds are completed, the aggregate model should achieve a
    validation accuracy of around 82%. Once again, the performance is
    nearly identical to the local training scenario.</li>
</ul>
<p>Integrating IBM FL for SST-2</p>
<ul>
<li>IBM FL uses a saved version of the model when performing FL. The
    following code (create_saved_model.py) initializes a model (calling
    the model on a dummy input to initialize the parameters) and then
    saves the model in the Keras SavedModel format for IBM FL to use:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>from tensorflow import keras</p>
<p>from sst_model import SSTModel</p>
<p>sst_model = SSTModel()</p>
<p>optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.005, amsgrad=False)</p>
<p>loss = keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(),</p>
<p>sst_model.compile(loss=loss, optimizer=optimizer)</p>
<p>sst_input = keras.Input(shape=(), dtype=tf.string)</p>
<p>sst_model(sst_input)</p>
<p>sst_model.save(\'sst_model_save_dir\')</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Run this once to save the model into the folder
    named sst_model_save_dir -- we will point IBM FL to load in the
    model saved in this directory.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Creating DataHandler</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Next, we create a subclass of the IBM FL DataHandler class in charge
    of providing the training and validation data to the model -- this
    subclass will load, preprocess, and store the SST datasets as class
    attributes. We first import the necessary libraries:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>from ibmfl.data.data_handler import DataHandler</p>
<p>import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>from sst_model import load_sst_data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The init function of this class loads the data info parameters,
    which are then used to load the correct SST-2 data partition:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>class SSTDataHandler(DataHandler):</p>
<p>def __init__(self, data_config=None):</p>
<p>super().__init__()</p>
<p>if (data_config is not None):</p>
<p>if (\'client_id\' in data_config):</p>
<p>self.client_id = int(data_config[\'client_id\'])</p>
<p>if (\'num_clients\' in data_config):</p>
<p>self.num_clients = int(data_config[\'num_clients\'])</p>
<p>train_data, val_data = load_sst_data(self.client_id-1,
self.num_clients)</p>
<p>self.train_dataset =
tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(train_data).batch(64)</p>
<p>self.val_dataset =
tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(val_data).batch(64)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We also implement the API function that returns the loaded datasets
    for use during training/validation:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def get_data(self):</p>
<p>return self.train_dataset, self.val_dataset</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<p><strong>Defining the configuration files</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The next step is to create the configuration JSON files used when
    starting the aggregator and initializing the parties. The
    aggregation config first specifies the connection information it
    will use to communicate with the parties:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>{</p>
<p>\"connection\": {</p>
<p>\"info\": {</p>
<p>\"ip\": \"127.0.0.1\",</p>
<p>\"port\": 5000,</p>
<p>\"tls_config\": {</p>

<p>\"sync\": \"False\"</p>
<p>},</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, we specify the fusion handler used for aggregation:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>\"fusion\": {</p>
<p>\"name\": \"IterAvgFusionHandler\",</p>
<p>\"path\": \"ibmfl.aggregator.fusion.iter_avg_fusion_handler\"</p>
<p>},</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We also specify the hyperparameters related to both local training
    and aggregation. perc_quorum refers to the percentage of parties
    that must participate before aggregation can begin:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>\"hyperparams\": {</p>
<p>\"global\": {</p>
<p>\"max_timeout\": 10800,</p>
<p>\"num_parties\": 1,</p>

<p>\"epochs\": 1</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>},</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we specify the IBM FL protocol handler to use:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>\"protocol_handler\": {</p>
<p>\"name\": \"ProtoHandler\",</p>
<p>\"path\": \"ibmfl.aggregator.protohandler.proto_handler\"</p>

<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>This configuration is saved in agg_config.json.</li>

</code></pre></div>
-   We also create the base party configuration file used to conduct FL
    with the local data. We first specify the connection information of
    the aggregator and the party:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{</p>
<p>\"aggregator\":</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>\"ip\": \"127.0.0.1\",</p>

<p>\"sync\": \"false\"</p>
<p>},</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We then specify the data handler and the local training handler to
    use -- this component trains the SST model using the model
    information and the local data:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>\"data\": {</p>
<p>\"info\": {</p>

<p>\"path\": \"ibmfl.party.training.local_training_handler\"</p>
<p>},</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The model format and information is then specified -- this is where
    we point to the saved model created earlier:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>\"model\": {</p>

<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we specify the protocol handler:</li>

<blockquote>
<p>\"protocol_handler\": {</p>
<p>\"name\": \"PartyProtocolHandler\",</p>
<p>\"path\": \"ibmfl.party.party_protocol_handler\"</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<p><strong>Creating IBM FL party</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With this, all that is left is the code that starts each party,
    saved in fl_sim.py. We first import the necessary libraries:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>import argparse</p>
<p>import json</p>
<p>from ibmfl.party.party import Party</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We include an argparse argument that allows for the party number to
    be specified -- this is used to modify the base party configuration
    file in order to allow for distinct parties to be started from
    the same file:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()</p>
<p>parser.add_argument(\"party_id\", type=int)</p>
<p>args = parser.parse_args()</p>
<p>party_id = args.party_id</p>
<p>with open(\'party_config.json\') as cfg_file:</p>
<p>party_config = json.load(cfg_file)</p>
<p>party_config[\'connection\'][\'info\'][\'port\'] += party_id</p>

f\'_{party_id}\'</p>
<p>party_config[\'data\'][\'info\'][\'client_id\'] = party_id</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we create and start a new Party object with the
    modified configuration information:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>party = Party(config_dict=party_config)</p>
<p>party.start()</p>
<p>party.register_party()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>With this, we can now begin performing FL using IBM FL.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Running the IBM FL example</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First, start aggregator by running the following command:</li>
</ul>
<p>python -m ibmfl.aggregator.aggregator agg_config.json</p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>After the aggregator is finished setting up, type START and
    press <em>Enter</em> key to open the aggregator to receive incoming
    connections. You can then start three parties using the following
    commands in separate terminals:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>python fl_sim.py 1</p>
<p>python fl_sim.py 2</p>
<p>python fl_sim.py 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, type TRAIN into the aggregator window and press <em>Enter</em> key
    to begin the FL process. When three rounds are completed, you can
    type SAVE into the same window to save the latest aggregate model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Integrating Flower for SST-2</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The two main Flower components that must be incorporated on top of
    the existing local training code are the client and strategy
    subclass implementations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client subclass implementation allows us to interface with
    Flower, with API functions that allow for model parameters to be
    passed between the clients and the server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The strategy subclass implementation allows us to specify the
    details of the aggregation approach performed by the server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-48-1" name="__codelineno-48-1" href="#__codelineno-48-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   We begin by writing the code to implement and start a client (stored
    in fl_sim.py). First, the necessary libraries are imported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>import argparse</p>
<p>import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>from tensorflow import keras</p>
<p>from sst_model import SSTModel, load_sst_data</p>
<p>import flwr as fl</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We add a command-line argument specifying the client ID in order to
    allow for the same client script to be reused for all three agents:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()</p>
<p>parser.add_argument(\"client_id\", type=int)</p>
<p>args = parser.parse_args()</p>
<p>client_id = args.client_id</p>
<p>NUM_CLIENTS = 3</p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<p>We then load in the SST-2 datasets:</p>
<p>(x_train,y_train), (x_test,y_test) = load_sst_data(client_id-1,
NUM_CLIENTS)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that we use the client ID to get the respective shard from
    the training dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-49-1" name="__codelineno-49-1" href="#__codelineno-49-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Next, we create the model and the associated optimizer and loss
    objects, making sure to call the model on a dummy input to
    initialize the weights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sst_model = SSTModel()</p>
<p>sst_model.compile(</p>
<p>optimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.005,
amsgrad=False),</p>
<p>loss = keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(),</p>
<p>metrics = [keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy()]</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>sst_input = keras.Input(shape=(), dtype=tf.string)</p>
<p>sst_model(sst_input)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<p><strong>Implementing the Flower client</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We can now implement the Flower client object that will pass model
    parameters to and from the server. To implement a client subclass,
    we have to define three functions:</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-50-1" name="__codelineno-50-1" href="#__codelineno-50-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   get_parameters(self, config): Returns the model parameter values</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>fit(self, parameters, config): Sets the weights of the local model
    to the received parameters, performs local training, and returns the
    new model parameters alongside the dataset size and training metrics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluate(self, parameters, config): Sets the weights of the local
    model to the received parameters, then evaluates the model on
    validation/test data and returns the performance metrics</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-51-1" name="__codelineno-51-1" href="#__codelineno-51-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Using fl.client.NumPyClient as the superclass allows us to take
    advantage of the Keras model get_weights and set_weights functions
    that convert the model parameters into lists of NumPy arrays:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>class SSTClient(fl.client.NumPyClient):</p>
<p>def get_parameters(self, config):</p>
<p>return sst_model.get_weights()</p>
<p>def fit(self, parameters, config):</p>
<p>sst_model.set_weights(parameters)</p>
<p>history = sst_model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)</p>
<p _train_loss_:history.history_91_loss_93_91_0_93_="\'train_loss\':history.history[\'loss\'][0]">return sst_model.get_weights(), len(x_train),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The evaluate function is also defined:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>def evaluate(self, parameters, config):</p>
<p>sst_model.set_weights(parameters)</p>
<p>loss, acc = sst_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=64)</p>
<p>return loss, len(x_train), {\'val_acc\':acc,
\'val_loss\':loss}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>With this client implementation, we can finally start the client
    using the default connection information with the following line:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>fl.client.start_numpy_client(server_address=\"[::]:8080\",
client=SSTClient())</p>

</code></pre></div>
-   The final step before running Flower is to create the script
    (server.py) that will start the Flower server. We begin with the
    necessary imports and the MAX_ROUNDS parameter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>import flwr as fl</p>
<p>import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>from tensorflow import keras</p>
<p>from sst_model import SSTModel</p>
<p>MAX_ROUNDS = 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Because we want to save the model after performing federated
    learning, we create a subclass of the flower FedAvg strategy and add
    a final step that saves the model at the last round during
    the aggregation phase:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>class SaveKerasModelStrategy(fl.server.strategy.FedAvg):</p>
<p>def aggregate_fit(self, server_round, results, failures):</p>
<p>agg_weights = super().aggregate_fit(server_round, results,
failures)</p>
<p>if (server_round == MAX_ROUNDS):</p>
<p>sst_model = SSTModel()</p>
<p>sst_input = keras.Input(shape=(), dtype=tf.string)</p>
<p>sst_model(sst_input)</p>
<p>sst_model.set_weights(fl.common.parameters_to_ndarrays(agg_weights[0]))</p>
<p>sst_model.save(\'final_agg_sst_model\')</p>
<p>return agg_weights</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>With this strategy, we can run the following line to start the
    server (passing the MAX_ROUNDS parameter through
    the config argument):</li>

-   Each of the three clients can then be started by running the
    following commands in separate terminal windows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>python fl_sim.py 1</p>
<p>python fl_sim.py 2</p>
<p>python fl_sim.py 3</p>

<li>The final aggregate model after FL will be saved in

</ul>
<p>Integrating STADLE for SST-2</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>STADLE differs from the previously examined FL frameworks by
    providing a cloud-based platform (STADLE Ops) to handle the
    deployment of aggregators and management of the FL process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the deployment of the server side can be done through the
    platform, the client-side implementation is all that needs to be
    implemented for performing FL with STADLE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This integration is done by creating a client object that
    occasionally sends the local model and returns the aggregate model
    from the previous round. To do this, we need to create the agent
    configuration file and modify the local training code to
    interface with STADLE.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-57-1" name="__codelineno-57-1" href="#__codelineno-57-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   First, we create the configuration file for the agent as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{</p>
<p>\"model_path\": \"./data/agent\",</p>
<p>\"aggr_ip\": \"localhost\",</p>
<p>\"reg_port\": \"8765\",</p>
<p>\"token\": \"stadle12345\",</p>
<p>\"base_model\": {</p>
<p>\"model_fn\": \"SSTModel\",</p>
<p>\"model_fn_src\": \"sst_model\",</p>
<p>\"model_format\": \"Keras\",</p>
<p>\"model_name\": \"Keras-SST-Model\"</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Information on these parameters can be found at
    https://stadle-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation.html#configuration-of-agent.
    Note that the aggregator IP and registration port values listed here
    are placeholders and will be modified when connecting to the
    STADLE Ops platform.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-58-1" name="__codelineno-58-1" href="#__codelineno-58-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Next, we modify the local training code to work with STADLE. We
    first import the requisite libraries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>import argparse</p>
<p>import tensorflow as tf</p>
<p>from tensorflow import keras</p>
<p>from sst_model import SSTModel, load_sst_data</p>
<p>from stadle import BasicClient</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Once again, we add a command-line argument to specify which
    partition of the training data the agent should receive:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()</p>
<p>parser.add_argument(\"client_id\", type=int)</p>
<p>args = parser.parse_args()</p>
<p>client_id = args.client_id</p>
<p>NUM_CLIENTS = 3</p>
<p>(x_train,y_train), (x_test,y_test) = load_sst_data(client_id-1,
NUM_CLIENTS)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, we instantiate a BasicClient object -- this is the STADLE
    client component that handles communication between the local
    training process and the aggregators on the server side. We use the
    configuration file defined earlier to create this client:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>stadle_client = BasicClient(config_file=\"config_agent.json\",
agent_name=f\"sst_agent_{client_id}\")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we implement the FL training loop. In each round, the
    client gets the aggregate model from the previous round (starting
    with the base model) and trains it further on the local data before
    sending it back to the aggregator through the client:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>for round in range(3):</p>
<p>sst_model = stadle_client.wait_for_sg_model()</p>
<p>history = sst_model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)</p>
<p>loss = history.history[\'loss\'][0]</p>
<p>stadle_client.send_trained_model(sst_model, {\'loss_training\':
loss})</p>
<p>stadle_client.disconnect()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The wait_for_sg_model function returns the latest aggregate model
    from the server, and the send_trained_model function sends the
    locally trained model with the desired performance metrics to the
    server. More information on these integration steps can be
    found at https://stadle-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#client-side-stadle-integration.</li>

-   The first step is to send the base model object to the server,
    allowing it to in turn distribute the model to the training
    agents. This is done with the following command:</p>
<p>stadle upload_model --config_path config_agent.json</p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the command successfully runs, the <strong>Base Model Info</strong> section

-   Evaluating the resulting aggregate models produced by each FL
    framework results in the same conclusion---the performance of the
    aggregate model essentially matches that of the centralized training
    model.</p>
<ul>
<li>As explained in the <em>Dataset distributions</em> section of <em>section
    7</em>, <em>Model Aggregation</em>, this is generally the expected result. The
    natural question to ask is how the performance is affected when the
    local datasets are not IID---this is the focal point of the next
    section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example -- the federated training of an image classification model on
non-IID data</p>
<ul>
<li>In the previous example, we examined how a centralized deep learning
    problem could be converted into an FL analog by training multiple
    clients on disjoint subsets of the original training dataset
    (the <em>local datasets</em>) in an FL process. One key point of this local
    dataset creation was that the subsets were created by random
    sampling, leading to local datasets that were all IID under the same
    distribution as the original dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-67-1" name="__codelineno-67-1" href="#__codelineno-67-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   As a result, the similar performance of FedAvg compared to the local
    training scenario was expected -- each client's model essentially
    had the same set of local minima to move toward during training,
    making all local training beneficial for the global objective.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-68-1" name="__codelineno-68-1" href="#__codelineno-68-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;

-   Recall that in <a href="https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/data/9781803247106/11/ch11lvl1sec61/B18369_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor176"><em>section
    7</em></a>, <em>Model
    Aggregation</em>, we explored how FedAvg was susceptible to the
    divergence in training objectives induced by severely non-IID local
    datasets.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To explore the performance of FedAvg on varying non-IID severities,
    this example trains the VGG-16 model (a simple deep-learning-based
    image classification model) on constructed non-IID local datasets
    sampled from the CIFAR-10 dataset (located
    at <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">[https://www.cs.toronto.edu/\~kriz/cifar.html]{.underline}</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CIFAR-10 is a well-known simple image classification dataset
    containing 60,000 images separated into 10 different classes; the
    goal of models trained on CIFAR-10 is to correctly predict the class
    associated with an input image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relatively low complexity and ubiquity as a benchmark dataset
    make CIFAR-10 ideal for exploring the response of FedAvg to non-IID
    data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Important note</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To avoid including redundant code samples, this section focuses on
    the key lines of code that allow FL to be performed on PyTorch
    models using non-IID local datasets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is recommended that you go through the examples within
    the <em>Example -- the federated training of an NLP model</em> section Here
    prior to reading this section in order to understand the core
    components needed for each FL framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The implementations for this example can be found in full at this
    book's GitHub repository

-   The key point of this example is determining how the non-IID
    datasets should be constructed. We will change the class label
    distributions of each local dataset by changing the number of images
    of each class included in the training dataset. </p>
<ul>
<li>For example, a dataset skewed toward cars and birds might have 5,000
    images of cars, 5,000 images of birds, and 500 images for every
    other class. By creating three disjointed subsets of the 10 classes
    and constructing local datasets skewed toward these classes, we
    produce three local datasets with non-IID severity proportional to
    the number of images included from the classes not selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Skewing the CIFAR-10 dataset</p>
<ul>
<li>We first map the three class subsets to client IDs, and set the
    proportion of images to be taken from the original dataset for
    selected classes (sel_count) and the other classes (del_count):</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>classes = (\'airplane\', \'automobile\', \'bird\', \'cat\', \'deer\',</p>
<p>\'dog\', \'frog\', \'horse\', \'ship\', \'truck\')</p>
<p>class_id_map = {</p>
<p>1: classes[:3],</p>
<p>2: classes[3:6],</p>
<p>3: classes[6:]</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>sel_count = 1.0, def_count = 0.2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We then sample the appropriate number of images from the original
    dataset, using the indices of the images in the dataset to construct
    the skewed CIFAR-10 subset:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>class_counts = int(def_count * 5000) * np.ones(len(classes))</p>
<p>for c in classes:</p>
<p>if c in class_rank_map[self.rank]:</p>
<p>class_counts[trainset.class_to_idx[c]] = int(sel_count *
5000)</p>
<p>class_counts_ref = np.copy(class_counts)</p>
<p>imbalanced_idx = []</p>
<p>for i,img in enumerate(trainset):</p>
<p>c = img[1]</p>
<p>if (class_counts[c] &gt; 0):</p>
<p>imbalanced_idx.append(i)</p>
<p>class_counts[c] -= 1</p>
<p>trainset = torch.utils.data.Subset(trainset, imbalanced_idx)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The skewed trainset is then used to create the
    skewed trainloader for local training. When we refer to biasing the
    training data going forward, this is the code that is run.</li>
</ul>

-   We will now demonstrate how to use different FL frameworks to run
    this non-IID FL process. Please refer to the installation
    instructions and framework-specific implementations in the previous
    section, <em>Example -- the federated training of an NLP model</em>, for
    the explanations of the basics omitted in this section.</p>
<p>Integrating OpenFL for CIFAR-10</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the Keras NLP example, we first create
    the ShardDescriptor and DataInterface subclasses for the non-IID
    CIFAR-10 datasets in cifar_fl_dataset.py. Only a few changes need to
    be made in order to accommodate the new dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-71-1" name="__codelineno-71-1" href="#__codelineno-71-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   First, we modify the self.data_by_type dictionary to instead store
    the modified CIFAR datasets:</p>
<p>train_dataset, val_dataset = self.load_cifar_data()</p>
<p>self.data_by_type = {</p>
<p>\'train\': train_dataset,</p>
<p>\'val\': val_dataset</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The load_cifar_data function loads in the training and test data
    using torchvision, then biases the training data based on the rank
    passed to the object.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-72-1" name="__codelineno-72-1" href="#__codelineno-72-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Because the dimensions of a data element are now known (the size of
    CIFAR-10 image), we also modify the shape properties with fixed
    values:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@property</p>
<p>def sample_shape(self):</p>
<p>return [\"32\", \"32\"]</p>
<p>@property</p>
<p>def target_shape(self):</p>
<p>return [\"10\"]</p>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We then implement the CifarFedDataset subclass of
    the DataInterface class. No significant modifications are needed for
    this implementation; thus, we can now use the biased CIFAR-10
    dataset with OpenFL.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-73-1" name="__codelineno-73-1" href="#__codelineno-73-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   We now move to the actual FL process implementation (fl_sim.py). One
    key difference is the framework adapter that must be used to create
    the ModelInterface object from a PyTorch model:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>model = vgg16()</p>
<p>optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9,
weight_decay=5e-4)</p>
<p>criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()</p>
<p>framework_adapter =
\'openfl.plugins.frameworks_adapters.pytorch_adapter.FrameworkAdapterPlugin\'</p>
<p>MI = ModelInterface(model=model, optimizer=optimizer,
framework_plugin=framework_adapter)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>The only other major change is modifying the train and validation
    functions passed to the TaskInterface object to mirror the PyTorch
    implementations of these functions from the local training code.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-74-1" name="__codelineno-74-1" href="#__codelineno-74-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   The last step is to create the configuration files used by the
    director and envoys. The only necessary change in the director
    config is the updated sample_shape and target_shape for the CIFAR-10
    data:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>settings:</p>
<p>listen_host: localhost</p>
<p>listen_port: 50051</p>
<p>sample_shape: [\"32\",\"32\"]</p>
<p>target_shape: [\"10\"]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>This is saved in director/director_config.yaml.</li>

</code></pre></div>
-   The envoy configuration files require no changes outside of updating
    the object and filenames -- the directory structure should look
    like the following:</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-76-1" name="__codelineno-76-1" href="#__codelineno-76-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;

    OpenFL for SST-2</em> section to run this example.</p>
<p>Integrating IBM FL for CIFAR-10</p>
<ul>
<li>Recall that IBM FL requires a saved version of the model used during
    training. We first run the following code
    in create_saved_model.py to create the saved VGG-16 PyTorch model:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>import torch</p>
<p>from torchvision.models import vgg16</p>
<p>model = vgg16()</p>
<p>torch.save(model, \'saved_vgg_model.pt\')</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Next, we create the DataHandler subclass for the skewed CIFAR-10
    datasets. The only core change is the modification of
    the load_and_preprocess_data function to instead load in the
    CIFAR-10 data and bias the training set.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-78-1" name="__codelineno-78-1" href="#__codelineno-78-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;

-   The next step is to create the configuration JSON files used when
    starting the aggregator and initializing the parties. No significant
    changes to the aggregator config (agg_config.json) are necessary,
    and the only core change in the party config is the modification of
    the model information to work with PyTorch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\"model\": {</p>
<p>\"name\": \"PytorchFLModel\",</p>
<p>\"path\": \"ibmfl.model.pytorch_fl_model\",</p>

<p>Integrating Flower for CIFAR-10</p>
<ul>
<li>After loading in the CIFAR-10 data and biasing the training data,
    the core change needed for the Flower implementation is
    the NumPyClient subclass. Unlike the Keras example,
    the get_parameters and set_parameters methods rely on the PyTorch
    model state dictionaries and are a bit more involved:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>class CifarClient(fl.client.NumPyClient):</p>
<p>def get_parameters(self, config):</p>
<p>return [val.numpy() for _, val in
model.state_dict().items()]</p>
<p>def set_parameters(self, parameters):</p>
<p>params_dict = zip(model.state_dict().keys(), parameters)</p>
<p>state_dict = OrderedDict({k: torch.tensor(v) for k, v in
params_dict})</p>
<p>model.load_state_dict(state_dict)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>We modify the fit function to mirror the training code in the local
    training example and modify the evaluate function to similarly
    mirror the local training evaluation code. Note that we
    call self.set_parameters(parameters) in order to update the local
    model instance with the most recent weights.</li>
</ul>

-   We also set the grpc_max_message_length parameter to 1 GB when
    starting the Flower client and server to accommodate the larger
    VGG16 model size. The client initialization function is now the
    following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fl.client.start_numpy_client(</p>
<p>server_address=\"[::]:8080\",</p>
<p>client=CifarClient(),</p>
<p>grpc_max_message_length=1024**3</p>
<p>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we modify the aggregator code in server.py -- the custom
    strategy we used previously to save the aggregate model at the end
    of the last round needs to be modified to work with PyTorch models:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>if (server_round == MAX_ROUNDS):</p>
<p>vgg_model = vgg16()</p>
<p>np_weights =
fl.common.parameters_to_ndarrays(agg_weights[0])</p>
<p>params_dict = zip(vgg_model.state_dict().keys(),
np_weights)</p>
<p>state_dict = OrderedDict({k: torch.tensor(v) for k, v in
params_dict})</p>
<p>torch.save(state_dict, \"final_agg_vgg_model.pt\")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>With this strategy, we can run the following line to start the
    server (adding the grpc_max_message_length parameter here as well):</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>fl.server.start_server(</p>
<p>strategy=SavePyTorchModelStrategy(),</p>
<p>config=fl.server.ServerConfig(num_rounds=MAX_ROUNDS),</p>
<p>grpc_max_message_length=1024**3</p>

<p>Integrating STADLE for CIFAR-10</p>
<ul>
<li>We first modify the config_agent.json config file to use the VGG16
    model from the torchvision library:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>{</p>
<p>\"model_path\": \"./data/agent\",</p>

<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CopyExplain</p>
<ul>
<li>To integrate STADLE into the local training code, we initialize
    the BasicClient object and modify the training loop to send the
    local model every two local training epochs and wait for the
    new aggregate model:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>stadle_client = BasicClient(config_file=\"config_agent.json\")</p>
<p>for epoch in range(num_epochs):</p>
<p>state_dict = stadle_client.wait_for_sg_model().state_dict()</p>
<p>model.load_state_dict(state_dict)</p>
<p># Normal training code...</p>

<li>
<p>The goal of this section was to build off of the understanding of
    each FL framework from the SST-2 example, highlighting the key
    changes necessary to work with a PyTorch model on a modified
    dataset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using this section alongside the code examples

    help in understanding this example integration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here, we covered several FL frameworks through the context of two
    different examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the first example, you learned how a traditional centralized ML
    problem can be converted into the analogous FL scenario by
    separating the data into disjointed subsets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is now clear that random sampling leads to local datasets that
    are IID, allowing FedAvg to reach the same level of performance as
    the centralized equivalent with any of the FL frameworks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second example, you learned one of the many ways a group of
    datasets can be non-IID (different class label distributions) and
    observed how different severities of non-IID datasets affect the
    performance of FedAvg. We encourage you to explore how alternative
    aggregation methods can improve on FedAvg in these cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both examples also should have given you a solid understanding of
    the general trends when working with different FL frameworks; while
    the specific implementation-level details may change (due to the
    rapidly changing field), the core concepts and implementation
    details will remain fundamentals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next section, we continue our transition to the business
    application side of FL by taking a look at several case studies
    involving the application of FL to specific domains.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Case Studies with Key Use Cases of Federated Learning Applications</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Federated learning</strong> (<strong>FL</strong>) has met with a variety of AI
    applications so far in various contexts and integration has been
    explored with trials and errors in those fields. One of the most
    popular areas has been in the medical and healthcare fields where
    the concept of privacy-preserving AI naturally fits with the current
    needs and challenges of healthcare AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL has also been applied to the financial services industry, edge
    computing devices, and the <strong>Internet of Things</strong> (<strong>IoT</strong>),
    through which FL has been shown to have significant benefits in
    quite a few applications, which will resolve many important social
    problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, we will be discussing some of the major use cases of FL in
    different fields. It is our hope that by the end of This section,
    you'll be familiar with some of the applications of FL in different
    industries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We\'ll start by exploring the use of FL in the healthcare and
    financial industries before making the transition to the edge
    computing and IoT sectors. Finally, we will conclude the section by
    discussing the intersection of FL and distributed learning for big
    data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, we will cover the following topics:</p>

<p>Applying FL to distributed learning for big data</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying FL to the healthcare sector</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FL used in healthcare is a topic that gained quite a lot of
    attention in the last couple of years. Healthcare advances can have
    an enormous effect on our lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, several challenges make these advances perhaps more
    difficult than in other domains. Let's begin by discussing some of
    the common challenges that exist and are preventing the further
    development of AI in healthcare.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Challenges in healthcare</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One of the primary challenges is data accessibility. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Data accessibility</em> is not an issue unique to healthcare. It is a
    huge problem across the AI industry and will only become a greater
    challenge as time goes on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a core problem in the development of AI in healthcare and we
    will touch briefly on some of the reasons why it is an issue here.
    We will also continue to revisit this major hurdle, addressing
    problems and solutions from many different angles and applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This strategy will allow you to understand the many different
    aspects, complexity, and drivers of the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The data accessibility problem has many components:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-83-1" name="__codelineno-83-1" href="#__codelineno-83-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   <strong>Privacy regulations</strong>: The main bottleneck of the data
    accessibility issue is centered around the privacy regulations put
    in place to protect personal data; these regulations are absolutely
    necessary and should be in place. Rather than circumventing these
    regulations, we'll be discussing how we can work in parallel with
    them, keeping these valuable regulations in place, and at the same
    time, making use of the intelligence that this data can provide. You
    can think of this as a best-of-both-worlds scenario. Several
    important privacy regulations are discussed in the <em>Data privacy as
    a bottleneck</em> section of <a href="https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/data/9781803247106/12/ch12lvl1sec68/B18369_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor017"><em>section
    1</em></a>, <em>Challenges
    in Big Data and Traditional AI</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of data/need for real data</strong>: Few areas hold as much promise
    for providing a positive societal impact as healthcare does. Yet,
    the healthcare industry has fallen far behind in capitalizing on all
    of the many benefits that AI has to offer. One reason for this is
    that for AI and ML models to learn effectively, they need large
    amounts of data. We'll discuss more on the need for large amounts of
    data throughout This section. This is the limiting factor for AI. In
    healthcare, there are many regulations in place that prevent these
    models from utilizing the data in any way, and rightfully so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Many data types from many places</strong>: As we'll discuss further,
    there are many different data types from many different places. Data
    can be in the form of text, video, images, or speech, which is
    stored in many different places. Aside from the ability to access
    data from many different locations, which is a major challenge on
    its own, these institutions store data in various formats as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-84-1" name="__codelineno-84-1" href="#__codelineno-84-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   As mentioned, some of the earliest work in the application of FL has
    been in the healthcare space. Within this large field, there are
    several ways FL can help solve problems. Let's take a look at just a
    few of the areas where FL has great potential to transform the
    healthcare system. Some of these areas include medical imaging, drug
    discovery, and <strong>Electronic Health Records</strong> (<strong>EHRs</strong>).</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's start by taking a closer look at how FL is being used
    in medical imaging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Medical imaging</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a lot of optimism surrounding FL in the medical imaging
    space as discussed in <em>A Comprehensive Analysis of Recent Deep and
    Federated-Learning-Based Methodologies for Brain Tumor Diagnosis</em>,
    which is listed in the <em>Further reading</em> section Here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These high expectations are, in part, due to some of the challenges
    that need to be addressed and the capability of FL to overcome these
    hurdles. One of these challenges is needing large amounts of data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Large amounts of medical imaging data are created every day as the
    medical imaging industry continues to develop better equipment,
    procedures, and facilities. The exponential growth of this data is a
    huge opportunity for healthcare providers to develop better ML
    models and increase the quality of healthcare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another reason for the optimism around FL having a positive impact
    on medical imaging is the already proven success of <strong>machine
    learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>) -- more
    specifically, <strong>deep learning</strong> (<strong>DL</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's take a brief look at DL to understand better why it is so
    important when dealing with large amounts of data. DL is a subspace
    of ML encompassed by the AI umbrella.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DL is different from ML in that it uses several layers of what are
    known as neural networks. Several books have been written on DL and
    neural networks as a singular subject, so we won't attempt to
    explain these in greater detail in this book. For more in-depth
    coverage of DL and neural networks, <em>Advanced Deep Learning with
    Python</em> is a great book to read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For our general discussion, we'll provide a very basic explanation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following figure, <em>Figure 9.1</em>, shows a simple example of a
    neural network being used to help classify types of brain tumors
    using medical imaging:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.1 -- Tumor classification with a neural network
" src="../images/media/image33.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="3.765277777777778in"}</p>
<p>Figure 9.1 -- Tumor classification with a neural network</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the left-hand side of the figure, we have an image of a brain
    that has one of two types of tumors. The image is broken down into
    numbers that represent the image pixels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These numbers are added to the neural network. The hidden layers
    utilize different weights for these numbers and produce different
    outputs through activation functions. Finally, we can see the two
    output layers. In this case, there are two possible outputs. One
    is <strong>Tumor is Type 1</strong> and the other is <strong>Tumor is Type 2</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Single location data is limited</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As you can see, DL models require a lot of data to train. Generally,
    a single data repository has only a small amount of data, limiting
    the ability of any model to generalize well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Possible solutions to data accessibility challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One solution is to utilize privacy-preserving FL, which can make use
    of all the data available in multiple centers while keeping
    sensitive data private.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL enables the deployment of large-scale ML models trained in
    different data centers without sharing sensitive data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In FL, rather than moving the data to the model to be trained, we
    move the model to the data and only bring back the intelligence
    gathered from the data, referred to as <strong>Intelligence from
    Data</strong> (<strong>IfD</strong>), discussed later in the <em>Potential of IfD</em> section
    in This section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example use case -- ML in hospitals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let's walk through an example of how FL could be applied to medical
    imaging data. This example is actually what was done in an
    international challenge focused on brain tumors. The goal here is to
    segment the tumor using MRI scans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For this example, we're going to use three hospitals. We will label
    them Hospital A, Hospital B, and Hospital C. Each hospital has
    anonymized private medical imaging data that is stored locally. Each
    hospital begins with a learning model, which you can see in
    the following diagram:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.2 -- Hospitals sharing ML models for FL
" src="../images/media/image32.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="5.235416666666667in"}</p>
<p>Figure 9.2 -- Hospitals sharing ML models for FL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each hospital runs the model locally; this creates what is referred
    to as a local model. It's important to note that each one of the
    hospital's local models will be different at this point. Each of
    them has only trained on the data that resides at their hospital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The intelligence from training these three local models is sent to a
    centralized server in the form of model parameters. The server
    gathers the local models and combines them to create a global model.
    This global model, a combination of the intelligence from all three
    local models, is then sent back to each hospital and is again
    trained locally only on that hospital's data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, only the intelligence from these models is sent back to the
    server for aggregation. This process is repeated until the model has
    learned all it can (known as convergence).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilizing FL, you can train models that perform as if all the data
    came from a single location even when data resides at different
    locations. As you can see, the implementation of privacy-preserving
    methods such as this one has the power to revolutionize the field of
    medicine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's now take a look at how FL can improve the drug discovery
    space.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Drug discovery</p>
<ul>
<li>Data has become somewhat of a new currency in our modern world. For
    pharmaceutical companies, especially, the use of this data to
    provide <em>personalized medicine</em> has become a major focus. In the
    years ahead, companies that can make use of more data will be far
    more competitive. This will be one of the defining strategies for
    the future success of any organization.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Precision medicine</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Personalized medicine, also known as <em>precision medicine</em>, relies
    heavily on large amounts of <em>real-world data </em>to make this possible.
    In addition, ML algorithms are needed to process and analyze this
    data in order to extract meaningful insights. As we will discuss,
    accessing significant amounts of real data is currently very
    difficult, if not impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-85-1" name="__codelineno-85-1" href="#__codelineno-85-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   In <em>Figure 9.3</em>, we show some of the areas where precision medicine
    will have an immediate impact:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.3 -- Precision medicine impacting many areas
" src="../images/media/image41.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="6.09375in"}</p>
<p>Figure 9.3 -- Precision medicine impacting many areas</p>
<ul>
<li>As you can see from <em>Figure 9.3</em>, precision medicine covers a vast
    area of different fields and disciplines, such as oncology,
    wellness, diagnostics, research, and health monitoring.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-86-1" name="__codelineno-86-1" href="#__codelineno-86-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Currently, many AI solutions that are deployed in the healthcare
    systems fail due to being created with small datasets that only
    represent a fraction of the patient population. Researchers and
    developers can validate and improve models using data from many
    sources without ownership.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-87-1" name="__codelineno-87-1" href="#__codelineno-87-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   To access this data so that it can be processed and analyzed, a new
    approach is needed. This is where FL comes in. As we've covered
    throughout this book, FL provides access to the intelligence needed,
    and not the data itself.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-88-1" name="__codelineno-88-1" href="#__codelineno-88-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Precision medicine is a model that proposes that rather than
    utilizing a <em>one-size-fits-all</em> approach, it should customize
    healthcare to individuals for better results in terms of drug
    effectiveness and cancer treatment outcomes, among other things. To
    do this, precision medicine relies heavily on large amounts of
    real-world data. Accessing large amounts of real-world data is the
    first hurdle that must be overcome to realize precision medicine at
    scale.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-89-1" name="__codelineno-89-1" href="#__codelineno-89-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Let's look at the current approach to see how FL can provide
    the needed answer.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-90-1" name="__codelineno-90-1" href="#__codelineno-90-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Shown in <em>Figure 9.4</em> is the current common approach to ML system
    implementation. Here, the data is transmitted to a central server,
    where all of the data is gathered together, and algorithms are then
    trained on this aggregated data. This is known as the <em>bringing the
    data to the model</em> approach:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.4 -- Precision medicine now

<p>Figure 9.4 -- Precision medicine now</p>
<ul>
<li>It's easy to imagine the immense cost of moving data from many
    hospitals into one centralized place in this fashion. Processing
    data in this way also compromises data security and makes regulatory
    compliance difficult, if not impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-91-1" name="__codelineno-91-1" href="#__codelineno-91-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   As shown in <em>Figure 9.5</em>, the FL approach is quite different.
    Instead of <em>bringing the data to the model</em>, the <em>model is moved to
    the data</em>. This means that the ML model trains on local data and
    only sends the intelligence to the FL server for aggregation, thus
    allowing the various local models to benefit from updates to
    the global model:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.5 -- Precision medicine with FL

height="3.7395833333333335in"}</p>
<p>Figure 9.5 -- Precision medicine with FL</p>
<ul>
<li>The FL approach allows for efficient model transfers and data
    security while being compliance-friendly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential of IfD</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Utilizing FL to gain access to real-world data has huge potential to
    improve all of the clinical research stages. Accessing this kind of
    data allows us to utilize the intelligence gathered and IfD can
    dramatically accelerate the processes and steps in drug discovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One important idea to keep in mind when discussing how FL works is
    that the training data never leaves the device.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-92-1" name="__codelineno-92-1" href="#__codelineno-92-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   <em>Figure 9.6</em> describes the process of extracting the ML model from
    training data through the training process:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.6 -- An IfD diagram

height="1.8090277777777777in"}</p>
<p>Figure 9.6 -- An IfD diagram</p>
<ul>
<li>As you can see in <em>Figure 9.6</em>, the data is used locally to train
    the ML model. In FL, the model is located on the device itself,
    where it is trained, and only the model weights are sent for
    aggregation -- so only the intelligence from the data, not the data
    itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-93-1" name="__codelineno-93-1" href="#__codelineno-93-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   The ability to gather IfD collected from multiple sources, as well
    as a wide range of data types, including video, text, speech, and
    other sensory data, can help improve enrollment processes, both in
    terms of the speed of doing so and finding the right match for the
    research and development of treatments.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-94-1" name="__codelineno-94-1" href="#__codelineno-94-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   This is especially important for rare diseases and cancers. When
    identifications are made in this way, subjects can be notified
    of trial opportunities.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-95-1" name="__codelineno-95-1" href="#__codelineno-95-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Federated access to data and the collection of IfD can open up
    access to a substantial amount of data worldwide. This allows for
    aggregated data repositories to mine a sufficient number of patients
    fulfilling the protocol criteria. Potentially, this could allow all
    participants in a trial to receive the actual drug and not the
    placebo.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-96-1" name="__codelineno-96-1" href="#__codelineno-96-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Ultimately, precision medicine at scale is not possible without
    robust AI and robust AI can only be trained with large amounts of
    real-world data. Using FL could allow for improved outcome
    measurements. In the coming years, a federated approach has the
    potential to drive advancements and innovation in the discovery of
    new medical treatments in new ways that have not been possible
    before.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-97-1" name="__codelineno-97-1" href="#__codelineno-97-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   In the following figure, <em>Figure 9.7</em>, we show a generalized view of
    how FL collects IfD:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.7 -- A generalized view of how FL collects IfD
" src="../images/media/image40.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="4.642361111111111in"}</p>
<p>Figure 9.7 -- A generalized view of how FL collects IfD</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As shown in <em>Figure 9.7</em> here, all the data remains isolated within
    each organization and is not transferred to the federated server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's now move forward and discuss an FL application with EHRs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>EHRs</p>
<ul>
<li>An EHR is a collection of health information that is systematically
    and digitally stored. These records are designed to be shared
    with <strong>healthcare providers</strong> (<strong>HCPs</strong>) when appropriate. According
    to <em>HealthIT.gov</em> statistics, as of 2017, 86% of office-based
    physicians have adopted EHRs in the United States.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-98-1" name="__codelineno-98-1" href="#__codelineno-98-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   <em>Figure 9.8</em> depicts the EHRs collected from various sources, such
    as hospitals and insurers. In this figure, we use the
    terms <strong>Electronic Medical Records</strong> (<strong>EMRs</strong>) and <strong>Personal
    Health Records</strong> (<strong>PHRs</strong>):</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.8 -- EHRs
" src="../images/media/image48.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="4.810416666666667in"}</p>
<p>Figure 9.8 -- EHRs</p>
<ul>
<li>This adoption of EHRs has laid the groundwork for beneficial
    collaboration between healthcare organizations. As we've discussed
    throughout the book, the ability to access more real-world data
    allows AI models trained on this data to be much more robust and
    effective.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-99-1" name="__codelineno-99-1" href="#__codelineno-99-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Although this foundation has been put in place, there are still many
    challenges to the traditional ML approach in terms of sharing EHR
    data across multiple institutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These include privacy concerns and regulations as well as data
    standardization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the major problems is the storage of this data in <strong>Central
    Data Repositories</strong> (<strong>CDRs</strong>), as shown in <em>Figure 9.9</em>, where
    various forms of local data are stored to be trained to create an ML
    model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.9 -- A centralized data mining method
" src="../images/media/image36.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="2.834722222222222in"}</p>
<p>Figure 9.9 -- A centralized data mining method</p>
<ul>
<li>This CDR approach is not ideal because of the data isolation
    problem, which is discussed in the following section.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The data isolation problem</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The use of CDRs for data storage brings many problems. Some examples
    include things such as <em>data leakage</em>, <em>hefty regulations</em>, and
    a <em>high cost</em> to set up and maintain.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-100-1" name="__codelineno-100-1" href="#__codelineno-100-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   The effect that data storage methods have on the quality and
    useability of the data itself is just as important. ML models
    trained on a single center data usually cannot generalize well when
    compared to data that has been gathered from multiple locations.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-101-1" name="__codelineno-101-1" href="#__codelineno-101-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   FL allows model training collaboration across multiple
    organizations, resulting in the production of superior model
    performance without violating data privacy regulations.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-102-1" name="__codelineno-102-1" href="#__codelineno-102-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Let's take a look at an example of an FL application with EHRs.</p>
<p><strong>Representation learning in EHRs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Researchers have applied FL to representation learning in EHRs as
    mentioned in the <em>Further reading</em> list such as <em>Two-stage federated
    phenotyping and patient representation learning</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-103-1" name="__codelineno-103-1" href="#__codelineno-103-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   They used FL with <strong>natural language processing</strong> (<strong>NLP</strong>)
    for phenotyping and representation learning with patient data. In
    the first stage, a representation of patient data is created based
    on some medical records from several hospitals without sharing the
    raw data itself.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-104-1" name="__codelineno-104-1" href="#__codelineno-104-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   The representation that has been learned is not limited to any
    specific medical task. In the second stage, an ML model for specific
    phenotyping work is trained in a federated manner using the related
    features derived from the learned representations.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-105-1" name="__codelineno-105-1" href="#__codelineno-105-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   FL has been showcased as an effective alternative to current
    methodologies in the advancement of AI developments in healthcare,
    whether in drug discovery, medical imaging, or the analysis of EHRs.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-106-1" name="__codelineno-106-1" href="#__codelineno-106-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Let's move on to the financial sector as another promising use case
    related to FL in the following section.</p>
<p>Applying FL to the financial sector</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the US alone, financial services firms spend billions of dollars
    every year on compliance to combat laundering, yet the current
    system is so ineffective that less than 1% of money laundering
    activities are thwarted. In fact, it's estimated that firms spend
    roughly 100 times more money than they are able to recover from this
    criminal activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only a small percentage of transactions are caught by <strong>anti-money
    laundering</strong> (<strong>AML</strong>) systems, and an even smaller percentage of
    those alerts are eventually reported in <strong>suspicious activity
    reports</strong> (<strong>SARs</strong>), as required by the <strong>Bank Secrecy
    Act </strong>(<strong>BSA</strong>) of 1970.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-107-1" name="__codelineno-107-1" href="#__codelineno-107-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Conservatively speaking, the value of information coming from a
    network of banks is many times higher than the information any one
    bank has. This is because you can see not just where the money came
    from, but also where it went.</p>
<p>Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</p>
<ul>
<li>The current AML system needs major improvements, with several
    challenges that need to be overcome. Many privacy regulations are in
    place to protect personal financial data. These regulations vary
    from institution to institution and region to region.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-108-1" name="__codelineno-108-1" href="#__codelineno-108-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   One solution is a collaboration between financial institutions. This
    collaboration would allow these institutions to share intelligence
    gathered from their own data in a mutually beneficial way. Rather
    than moving data between collaborators, the ML models themselves
    would be deployed locally at each institution.</p>
<ul>
<li>This would allow only the IfD to be shared and benefit each
    collaborator that could utilize the intelligence gathered. As we've
    discussed, FL has this capability.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-109-1" name="__codelineno-109-1" href="#__codelineno-109-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   In FL, the models themselves move from institution to institution.
    While doing so, the models adjust parameters and become more
    intelligent as they learn from more data. This is different from
    these two alternatives to FL:</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-110-1" name="__codelineno-110-1" href="#__codelineno-110-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   One option is to collect the data from the collaborating financial
    institutions into one central repository. However, this approach
    isn't possible due to customer privacy regulations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Another approach is to share some kind of identifier as necessary.
    However, again due to privacy laws and regulations, this is not
    possible and could only be used as part of an investigation process.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-111-1" name="__codelineno-111-1" href="#__codelineno-111-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   To be able to use FL, we need to be able to ensure that the privacy
    and security of data remain intact. To do so, we must ensure that
    the models are being trained in a financial institution without
    privacy violations. Lastly, we need to ensure that all communication
    related to model parameter updates sent to the federated server is
    safe and secure.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-112-1" name="__codelineno-112-1" href="#__codelineno-112-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   FL can improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and fairness of the
    global BSA and AML regimes. In the following section, we will look
    at using FL in the context of transaction monitoring implementation
    across AML disciplines.</p>
<p>Proposed solutions to the existing AML approach</p>
<ul>
<li>The development of FL approaches across AML disciplines includes the
    essential topic of customer onboarding and it may help to use
    non-traditional information to verify the identities of potential
    customers.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-113-1" name="__codelineno-113-1" href="#__codelineno-113-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   A new approach is needed that can leverage sophisticated technology
    to increase the awareness and efficiency of risk detection systems.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-114-1" name="__codelineno-114-1" href="#__codelineno-114-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   This approach should enable the following:</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-115-1" name="__codelineno-115-1" href="#__codelineno-115-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Enable firms and regulators to learn from each other without sharing
    sensitive or protected data</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enhance the ability of firms to identify accurately real risks and
    reduce unfounded risk reporting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve the risk-reward calculi of firms when making decisions about
    whether to serve specific markets</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-116-1" name="__codelineno-116-1" href="#__codelineno-116-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   The AML framework serves a vital national interest in preventing any
    intent of harm, whether through terrorism, money laundering, fraud,
    or human trafficking, using the global financial system for
    those illegal purposes.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-117-1" name="__codelineno-117-1" href="#__codelineno-117-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Although there has been enormous investment in and attention to
    money laundering risk detection systems, the system is broken. Firms
    invest considerable resources to satisfy AML requirements but get
    little feedback on the quality of their risk reporting.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-118-1" name="__codelineno-118-1" href="#__codelineno-118-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Two key factors have driven firms out of operating in specific
    markets:</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-119-1" name="__codelineno-119-1" href="#__codelineno-119-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   The first is the costs of risk rating activity that occurs within
    the money services industry</p>
<ul>
<li>The second key factor is the regulatory risks and reputational
    impact for financial firms connected to illicit financial activities</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-120-1" name="__codelineno-120-1" href="#__codelineno-120-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   As a result, globally, correspondent banking relationships have
    fallen by 25%. Since 2009, 25% of banks in emerging markets have
    reported correspondent banking losses.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-121-1" name="__codelineno-121-1" href="#__codelineno-121-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   In <em>Figure 9.10</em>, transaction reporting is depicted and each
    institution's database of risk patterns reflects its experience
    with illicit activities:</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.10 -- Institutional reporting of suspected illicit activity
" src="../images/media/image28.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="4.373611111111111in"}</p>
<p>Figure 9.10 -- Institutional reporting of suspected illicit activity</p>
<ul>
<li>Institutions won't necessarily know about patterns their competitors
    are picking up or what the government knows about which transactions
    flagged are suspicious or genuine. Firms get little timely feedback
    on the accuracy of the reports they submit. The result is that firms
    lack the most vital information for improving their risk detection
    capabilities: timely information about confirmed problems.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-122-1" name="__codelineno-122-1" href="#__codelineno-122-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   So, imagine transaction monitoring that is more effective,
    efficient, and fair in this scenario. The bank acts as a
    utility-like hub.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Powerful computers combined with smart algorithms could be deployed
    to evaluate data at different institutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ML model that has learned the risk patterns would then move
    between the participating firms to pick up the patterns and learn
    from the risk at each institution. All of this could be done without
    sharing sensitive or protected data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is depicted in <em>Figure 9.11</em>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.11 -- The data and intelligence flow within a banking
ecosystem " src="../images/media/image73.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"

<p>Figure 9.11 -- The data and intelligence flow within a banking ecosystem</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the FL approach, the bank creates a classification algorithm that
    trains on each participating firm's data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bank develops a key model and model parameters that reflect
    insights from all participating firms and the data in the
    government's possession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bank distributes the key model and model parameters to the
    participating firms while the data stays in each institution. These
    distributed models adopt the risk patterns in those firms by
    learning from their local data and then sending them back to the
    bank.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Demo of FL in the AML space</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The researchers at TieSet, Inc. have conducted an experiment of
    applying FL to the AML space over STADLE, using some synthetic
    transaction data generated by the PaySim mobile money simulator
    (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ealaxi/paysim1">[https://www.kaggle.com/ealaxi/paysim1]{.underline}</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They have used supervised learning with logistic regression where
    model features include time, amount, and the new and old balance of
    the original account and the destination account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dataset has 636,2620 transactions (8,213 fraud transactions and
    635,4407 valid transactions), which are split into 10 separate local
    agents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Figure 9.12</em> is the outcome of applying FL to AML where the
    precision score and F1 score are plotted at each round of training.
    In the figure, the thicker line is the performance of the aggregated
    model, and the thin lines are the results of individual agents
    training separately only using local data:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.12 -- Outcome of applying FL to AML (thicker line: aggregated

<p>Figure 9.12 -- Outcome of applying FL to AML (thicker line: aggregated
model, thin lines: individual agent training separately)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As in <em>Figure 9.12</em>, the aggregated model performs in a quite stable
    manner, constantly achieving more than 90% in terms of precision and
    F1 score. FL could reduce the fraud transactions down from the total
    fraud transactions of $1,241,770,000 to $65,780,000, meaning only
    5.3% of fraud transactions are missing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's conclude this section by looking at a list of benefits that FL
    provides for risk detection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Benefits of FL for risk detection systems</p>
<ul>
<li>There are several benefits in financial sectors for applying FL to

-   The ability to identify money laundering tactics within your own
    financial institution is limited by the data you have access to.
    Data sharing restrictions make collaboration difficult, if not
    impossible.</p>

<p>The solutions and advantages that FL brings to the finance industry
    are numerous. Additional advantages include better operational
    efficiency and better allocation of human capital.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no limit to the application of FL, especially in the
    financial space, due to the ability to extract intelligence
    from client data.</p>

<li>
<p>We'll now be switching gears a bit as we move on to discussing the
    use of FL in several emerging technologies in the following section.</p>

<p>FL meets edge computing</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The section in this section is a mixture of different areas, some of
    which are emergent technologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These areas are all very interconnected, as we will cover. Many of
    these technologies depend on one another to overcome their own
    challenges and limitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combining these technologies alongside FL is an especially potent
    combination of technology that is sure to be key to advancements and
    innovation in the coming years.</p>

-   In the decade ahead, we will see several changes brought about by
    the expansion of edge computing capabilities, IoT, and 5G
    connectivity.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We will see an exponential increase in both the amount of data and
    the speed at which it is transmitted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will continue to see more privacy regulations put in place to
    protect private user data and an explosion in the automation
    and analytics areas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Edge computing with IoT over 5G</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The foundation for realizing the full potential of smart devices is
    only possible if these devices are able to connect with a
    much-improved network, such as 5G.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, by the end of 2023, it is expected that there will be 1.3
    billion subscribers to 5G services worldwide. Alongside edge
    computing, 5G networks are essential for IoT connectivity. Combining
    these technologies will help pave the way for smart devices.</p>

<li>
<p>Many of these IoT devices, however, lack adequate security
    capabilities. In addition to laws and regulations such as
    the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong>GDPR</strong>), we can also
    expect additional policies to be implemented to protect user data.
    Essentially the need for a solution that extracts IfD will continue
    to build as more time passes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's take a look at an example of FL applied to edge computing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Edge FL example -- object detection</p>
<ul>
<li>Edge computing is an architecture that uses distributed computing to
    bring computation and data storage as close to the sources of data
    as possible. Ideally, this should reduce latency and save bandwidth.
    Here's an example of how FL can be utilized with different types
    of edge devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical settings</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this example, three devices were used to demonstrate object
    detection with FL using edge devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One was an EIS200 edge microserver that ran on Nvidia's Jetson with
    an Ubuntu OS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second device was a Raspberry Pi, using Raspberry Pi OS, and the
    third device was simply a regular PC, whose OS was Ubuntu as well.
    These machines individually trained an object detection model
    with unique datasets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How to do it</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The EIS200 trained on pictures of fish, meat, and tomatoes with the
    labels <em>fish</em>, <em>meat</em>, and <em>vegetable</em>. The Raspberry Pi trained on
    pictures of fish, meat, and eggplants. Evidently, here, tomatoes
    were replaced with eggplants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The labels, however, remained the same -- fish, meat, and vegetable.
    Likewise, the regular PC trained on pictures of fish, meat, and
    leeks, still with the labels fish, meat, and vegetable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you would expect, each environment had biased data containing
    different vegetables -- as in, tomatoes, eggplants, and leeks --
    with an identical label, vegetable, for all of them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How it works</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, the model was trained with pictures of tomatoes by EIS200. As
    you would expect, only tomatoes were correctly labeled as
    vegetables, whereas eggplants and leeks were mislabeled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the same manner, the Raspberry Pi's model trained with pictures
    of eggplants only identified eggplants correctly. One of the two
    leeks was labeled as a vegetable as well, but the other one was
    identified as fish. As expected, the regular PC's model only
    identified leeks as vegetables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of the three agents could label all three vegetables correctly,
    as we would have anticipated. Next, they were connected to an FL
    platform called STADLE, developed by TieSet, Inc:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.14 -- Demo of detecting tomatoes, eggplants, and leeks using
FL where the distribution of the datasets is different on each machine
" src="../images/media/image59.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="3.2736111111111112in"}</p>
<p>Figure 9.14 -- Demo of detecting tomatoes, eggplants, and leeks using FL
where the distribution of the datasets is different on each machine</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The STADLE aggregator was run as an instance in AWS. Here, again,
    each environment had a uniquely biased dataset containing only one
    type of vegetable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connected with the STADLE platform, each agent trained with local
    data. After several training epochs, the weights of the models were
    sent from the agents to the aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those weights were then aggregated and sent back to the agents to
    continue training. The repetition of this aggregation cycle
    generated unbiased weights.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examining the results</p>
<ul>
<li>The FL model was able to detect and label all three types of
    vegetables correctly as in <em>Figure 9.15</em>. This is a straightforward
    example of the power of FL in terms of bias elimination:</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.15 -- Results of the demo using three edge devices
" src="../images/media/image62.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="3.8965277777777776in"}</p>
<p>Figure 9.15 -- Results of the demo using three edge devices</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As mentioned previously, all of the model training took place at the
    local storage of the edge device itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The model trained on the local data and then only sent the parameter
    weights to the federated server for aggregation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federated server averaged the model. If you recall from earlier
    sections, this is called FedAvg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The federated server then sent back the improved and updated model
    to the edge device. So, again, only IfD is collected, not the data
    itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, let's look at another edge example in the automotive sector in
    the following section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Making autonomous driving happen with FL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Edge computing with ML gains significant interest in AI industries
    at scale, especially in the automotive field. Use cases such as
    autonomous driving require low latency and real-time responses to
    operate correctly. Therefore, FL becomes one of the best solutions
    for the automotive field in terms of distributed data processing and
    training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offloading computation and storage to edge IoT devices makes the
    cloud systems for managing autonomous driving applications much
    smaller and cheaper. That's the most powerful benefit of moving on
    to the FL paradigm from central cloud-based ML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modern cars already have edge devices with complex computing
    capabilities. <strong>Advanced Driver Assistance Systems</strong> (<strong>ADASs</strong>) are
    the essential functions for autonomous cars where calculations
    happen onboard. They also require significant computation power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The model is trained and prepared using regular, costly training
    systems within on-premises servers or in the cloud even if the
    prediction happens in the autonomous vehicle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The training process will become more computationally expensive and
    slower if the data becomes bigger and will require significant
    storage as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL needs to be used to avoid those issues because updated ML models
    are passed between the vehicles and the server where the car stores
    the user driving patterns and streaming images from the onboard
    camera. FL, again, can work in accordance with user consent and
    adherence to privacy and regional regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Figure 9.16</em> is about decentralized FL with multiple aggregators to
    improve ADASs for safe driving, conducted as a real use case by
    TieSet, Inc. with its technological partner:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.16 -- Decentralized FL with multiple aggregators to improve
ADASs for safe driving

<p>Figure 9.16 -- Decentralized FL with multiple aggregators to improve
ADASs for safe driving</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ADAS integrated into the STADLE of TieSet, Inc., tailored to
    provide comfort and personal safety measures, especially to senior
    citizens, delivered optimized steering controlling assistance for
    car products.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Via advanced computer vision and <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> (<strong>RL</strong>)
    technologies, they achieved a design that provides prompt danger
    situation awareness and intelligently learns about the
    best-personalized driving strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While personalization is a principal focus of the design,
    substantial privacy issues come with personal data usage. The FL
    framework enabled by the STADLE platform provided a realistic
    solution to overcome this barrier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The architecture, presenting a collaborative form of ML training
    distributed among edge users via AI intelligence exchanges, avoids
    data transferal and ensures data privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, the aggregated models can cope with various risky and
    unpredictable situations beyond the personal experience of drivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the proof of concept using real cars, they successfully
    demonstrated that the designed RL model could efficiently generate
    the desirable steering strategy customized for the drivers using
    STADLE's aggregation framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the following section, we will talk about how FL could be applied
    to the robotics domain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying FL to robotics</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In robotics systems and applications, ML has already become an
    integral and essential part of completing necessary tasks. Computer
    vision has evolved to make robotics systems perform very well for
    many tasks, such as image segmentation and object detection and
    classification as well as NLP and signal processing tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ML can handle many robotics tasks, including perception, path
    planning, sensor fusion, and grasping detected objects
    in manufacturing settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, ML in robotics also has many challenges. The first is the
    training time. Even when the amount of data is enough to train the
    ML models to solve the aforementioned problems, it takes weeks or
    months to train an authentic robotics system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equally, if the data is not sufficient, it can restrict the ML model
    performance significantly. Often, data privacy and accessibility
    become an issue for collecting enough data to train the ML models
    for the robots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is why the FL framework is considered an essential solution to
    the domain of robotics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Researchers at TieSet, Inc. developed a system and methods that
    allow robotic manipulators and tools to share their manipulation
    skills (including reaching, pick-and-place, holding, and grasping)
    for objects of various types and shapes with other robots, as well
    as use the skills of other robots to improve and expand their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This system covers the methods to create a general manipulation
    model for robots that continuously improves by crowdsourcing skills
    from various robotic agents while keeping the data private.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They propose a new architecture where multiple AI-powered robotic
    agents collaboratively train a global manipulation model by
    submitting their models to an aggregator. This communication enables
    each agent to utilize the training results of the agents by
    receiving an optimally updated global model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Figure 9.17</em> is the architecture showing how the federated
    crowdsourced global manipulation framework for robotics works:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.17 -- Architecture of the federated crowdsourced global
manipulation framework for robotics

height="5.684027777777778in"}</p>
<p>Figure 9.17 -- Architecture of the federated crowdsourced global
manipulation framework for robotics</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Based on the architecture of the preceding figure, in the simulation
    settings, they prepare five robotic arms for the individual tasks of
    grabbing boxes, balls, ducks, and teddies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the STADLE platform by TieSet, Inc., which can conduct
    asynchronous FL, the ML models from those arms are aggregated
    continuously. In the end, the federated robotics ML model can grab
    all these objects, whether boxes, balls, ducks, or teddies, with a
    higher performance (an 80% success rate) in grabbing those objects,
    as seen in <em>Figure 9.18</em>:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.18 -- Arm robots can cross-train with different tasks for
accuracy and efficiency

<p>Figure 9.18 -- Arm robots can cross-train with different tasks for
accuracy and efficiency</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The FL based on STADLE could significantly reduce the time taken to
    train robots and ML for production lines using computer vision.
    Federated performance is much better than training individual robots
    and the learning time is much faster than when training individual
    robots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the following section, we will talk about AI at scale, where
    learning should constantly happen even with numerous devices with
    connected environments and the IoT should evolve into the
    Internet of Intelligence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving toward the Internet of Intelligence</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this section, we will talk about why FL is quite important in the
    context of the latest development of scalable technologies, such as
    the IoT and 5G.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As in the previous section, the areas in which AI needs to keep
    learning at scale include autonomous driving, retail systems, energy
    management, robotics, and manufacturing, all of which generate a
    huge amount of data on the edge side, and most of the data needs to
    be fully learned to generate performant ML models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following this trend, let us look into the world of the Internet of
    Intelligence, in which learning can happen on the edge side to cope
    with dynamic environments and numerous devices connected to the
    Internet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Introducing the IoFT</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The IoT involves intelligent and connected systems. They are
    intelligent because the information is shared and intelligence is
    extracted and used for some purpose -- for example, prediction or
    control of a device. They are often connected to the cloud and are
    able to collect data from many endpoints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Figure 9.19</em> shows the current IoT system with more and more
    data over time:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.19 -- A current IoT system
" src="../images/media/image66.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="3.9027777777777777in"}</p>
<p>Figure 9.19 -- A current IoT system</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As shown in <em>Figure 9.19</em>, in the current IoT flow, large amounts of
    data must be uploaded and stored in the cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The models train for specific purposes, such as predictive
    maintenance and text prediction. Finally, the trained models are
    sent back to the edge devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you can see, there are several issues with the current approach:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-126-1" name="__codelineno-126-1" href="#__codelineno-126-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   A large amount of storage space is needed</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Latency is affected due to the amount of data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privacy issues due to the movement of data</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-127-1" name="__codelineno-127-1" href="#__codelineno-127-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   To overcome these issues, FL plays an important role.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Internet of Federated Things</strong> (<strong>IoFT</strong>) is an idea
    originally presented by researchers at the University of Michigan,
    whose paper <em>The Internet of Federated Things </em>(<em>IoFT</em>) is listed in
    the <em>Further reading</em> section of This section. The IoFT is an
    extended framework combining IoT with the concept of FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the computational power on the edge side has improved
    significantly, AI chips have been penetrating the market rapidly.
    Even smartphones have a really strong computing capability these
    days and small but powerful computers are often attached to
    most edge devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, the ML model training process is brought down to the edge
    due to the increased computational capability of edge devices, and
    the IoT's functionality of sending data to the server can be used to
    transmit ML models to the cloud. This is also a very effective
    approach to protecting private data on edge devices, such as mobile
    phones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's take a look at an example of the IoFT shown in <em>Figure 9.20</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.20 -- An example of the IoFT

<p>Figure 9.20 -- An example of the IoFT</p>
<ul>
<li>Potential applications of the IoFT include distributed
    manufacturing, traffic intersection control, and energy control, to
    name a few.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding the role of FL in Web 3.0</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FL can be integrated into Web 3.0 technologies to accelerate the
    adoption of the Internet of Intelligence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The intelligence represented by ML models could be the property of
    particular individuals or industries. At the same time, it could be
    considered a public asset if it is something that could contribute
    to the entire learning process of that ML model for people
    worldwide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether private intellectual property or public assets, by utilizing
    Web 3.0 technology, intelligence can be managed and evolved in a
    decentralized manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, more and more people will receive the benefits of
    intelligence that people have collaboratively trained, which leads
    to the true innovation of our entire society in various domains and
    with various applications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying FL to distributed learning for big data</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this section, we will discuss how FL can be applied to
    distributed learning in the context of big data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL for big data may not be related to privacy-related issues so much
    because the data needed for intelligence purposes is already
    possessed. Therefore, it may be more applicable to efficient
    learning for big data and improving training time significantly, as
    well as reducing the costs of using huge servers, computation, and
    storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are several ways to conduct distributed learning on big data,
    such as building a specific end-to-end ML stack applied to different
    types of servers, such as parameter servers, or utilizing certain ML
    schemes on top of big data platforms such as Hadoop and Spark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are also some other platforms, such as GraphLab and Pregel.
    You can use any libraries, and methods such as stochastic proximal
    descent and coordinate descent with low-level utilities for ML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These frameworks can support the parallel training of ML models
    computationally, but will not be able to assign the data source to
    different machines to train them locally in a distributed way,
    especially when the training environments are dispersed over the
    Internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With FL, you can simply aggregate what different distributed
    machines learn just by synchronizing the federation of the models,
    but you do need to develop a well-designed platform to coordinate
    the continuous operation of distributed learning, with proper model
    repository and versioning approaches as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An example of conducting distributed learning on big data is
    depicted in <em>Figure 9.21</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 9.21 -- Distributed learning integration into big data
" src="../images/media/image60.jpg" />{width="6.268055555555556in"
height="3.6145833333333335in"}</p>
<p>Figure 9.21 -- Distributed learning integration into big data</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the example in <em>Figure 9.21</em>, the data source, which is typically
    very large, is sharded into multiple data sources to be dispersed
    even into different machines or instances that are available for
    training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within an FL framework, trained models from distributed environments
    are all aggregated. The trained and aggregated model then goes to
    the processes of <strong>ML Operations</strong> (<strong>ML Ops</strong>) for performance
    validation and continuous monitoring with <strong>Model
    Operations</strong> (<strong>Model Ops</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another layer on top of the preceding scenario can be to combine the
    insights from the other data sources. In this case, the FL can
    elegantly combine the insights from the other data sources and
    nicely coordinate the integration of the other forms of intelligence
    directly created in the distributed environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This way, you can also create the hybrid model of centralized ML and
    distributed ML as well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here, we discussed many of the challenges facing different
    industries in terms of AI advancements. The majority of the
    challenges are related in some way to data accessibility. Issues
    such as data privacy regulations, lack of real data, and data
    transmission costs are all unique and challenging problems that we
    expect to see FL continue to help solve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, you learned about the use cases of the areas in which the FL
    is playing a more and more important role, such as healthcare,
    financial, edge, and IoT domains. The adherence to privacy that FL
    offers is particularly important for the healthcare and financial
    sectors, while FL can add significant value in terms of scalability
    and learning efficiency to lots of edge AI and IoT scenarios. You
    also learned how to apply FL to distributed learning for big data to
    reduce training time and costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next and final section, we will wrap up this work by
    discussing the very exciting future trends and developments in which
    FL is expected to play a key role in the coming decade.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Future Trends and Developments</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Intelligence will drive the next generation of technologies, not big
    data. Big data systems have some issues, as discussed in <a href="https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/data/9781803247106/13/ch13lvl1sec75/B18369_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor017"><em>section
    1</em></a>, <em>Challenges
    in Big Data and Traditional AI</em>, and the world is gradually
    transitioning from the data-centric era to the intelligence-centric
    generation. <strong>Federated learning</strong> (<strong>FL</strong>) will play a core role in
    wisdom-driven technologies. Thus, the time is now to welcome the
    world of collective intelligence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, we will talk about the direction of future AI technologies
    that are driven by the paradigm shift happening with FL. For many AI
    fields, such as privacy-sensitive areas and fields requiring
    scalability in <strong>machine learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>), the benefits and
    potential of FL are already significant, mainly because of the
    privacy-preserving and distributed learning aspects that FL
    naturally supports with its design. You will then learn about the
    different types of FL as well as the latest development efforts in
    that area, as seen in the split and swarm learning techniques, which
    can be considered as evolutional frameworks enhancing FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, FL creates a new concept of an <em>Internet of
    Intelligence</em>, where people and computers exchange their wisdom
    instead of just data themselves. The Internet of Intelligence for
    everyone is further accelerated by blockchain technologies as well.
    This Internet of Intelligence can then form a newly defined concept
    of <em>collective intelligence</em> that drives another innovation,
    from <em>data-centric</em> approaches
    to <em>intelligence-centric</em> or <em>model-centric</em> approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we will share a collective vision in which FL plays a key
    role in collaboratively creating intelligence learned by many people
    and machines around the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, we will cover the following topics:</p>

<li>
<p>Ongoing research and developments in FL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Journeying on to collective intelligence</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at future AI trends</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of industry leaders are now aware of the limitations of
    centralized ML as discussed in the next section.</li>
</ul>
<p>The limitation of centralized ML</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When looking at the future of AI, it is important to first know the
    fact that many companies today are struggling to extract
    intelligence and obtain insight from the data they possess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than half of the data that organizations and companies have
    collected is usually not used. Traditional approaches to machine
    learning and data science need data to be organized and consolidated
    into data lakes and stores in advance of analyzing and training ML
    models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to duplicate and move the data, which will result in delays
    in realizing and delivering the value of the intelligence extracted
    from the data, together with certain operational risks and
    complexities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, most of the data generated by enterprise companies will
    be created and processed outside a traditional centralized data
    center or cloud. It is becoming increasingly unrealistic and
    inefficient to process data for generating insight in a centralized
    manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, based on some market reports out there, most of the
    largest global organizations and companies will explore FL at least
    once to create much more accurate, secure, and sustainable models
    environmentally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That being said, quite a few industries and markets are gradually
    becoming aware of the importance of a distributed and FL paradigm,
    because they are facing the unavoidable issues and limitations of
    the current centralized AI training with big data, as discussed
    in <a href="https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/data/9781803247106/13/ch13lvl1sec75/B18369_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor017"><em>section
    1</em></a>, <em>Challenges
    in Big Data and Traditional AI</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL brings the model to the data where the training process resides
    instead of bringing the data to the model. Thus, FL is considered to
    be the future of data science and ML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next section, let's summarize the points of why FL is
    beneficial to those companies, especially enterprises that have been
    facing the aforementioned issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Revisiting the benefits of FL</p>
<ul>
<li>In this section, we will summarize the benefits of FL that have been
    introduced throughout this book.</li>
</ul>
<p>Increased model accuracy and generalizability</p>
<ul>
<li>FL realizes collaborative and distributed learning that can improve
    the performance of ML models, by training on dispersed datasets
    locally to continuously incorporate the learning into a global
    model. This way, more accurate and generalized ML models can be
    produced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further privacy and security</p>
<ul>
<li>FL provides privacy and security advantages because it won't require
    private and raw data by its design and security mechanisms, as we
    discussed previously in <a href="https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/data/9781803247106/13/ch13lvl1sec75/B18369_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em>section
    2</em></a>, <em>What
    Is Federated Learning?</em> and <a href="https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/data/9781803247106/13/ch13lvl1sec75/B18369_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor224"><em>section
    9</em></a>, <em>Case
    Studies with Key Use Cases of Federated Learning Applications</em>.
    Thus, FL reduces the potential risk of data misuse, leakage, or
    exposure to sensitive information. FL is also compliant with many
    privacy regulations, such as <strong>General Data Protection
    Regulation</strong> (<strong>GDPR</strong>), <strong>California Consumer Privacy
    Act</strong> (<strong>CCPA</strong>), and <strong>Health Insurance Portability and
    Accountability Act</strong> (<strong>HIPAA</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Improved speed and efficiency</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FL is also known to realize high computation efficiency, which can
    accelerate the deployment and testing of ML models as well as
    decrease communication and computational latency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to the decentralized nature of FL, the delay for model delivery
    and update is minimized, which leads to a prediction by the global
    model in near real time. Real-time delivery and updates of
    intelligence are really valuable for time-sensitive ML applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL also helps reduce bandwidth and energy consumption by overcoming
    system heterogeneity and unbalanced data distribution, which leads
    to minimizing data storage and transfer costs that can also
    significantly contribute to reducing the environmental impact.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Toward distributed learning for further privacy and training efficiency</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Currently, AI is trained on huge computational servers,
    usually happening on big machines in big data companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As seen in the era of the supercomputer, which can process a huge
    amount of data and tasks within one machine or one cluster of
    machines, the evolutionary process in technology starts from a
    central location and gradually transitions to distributed
    environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same thing is exactly about to happen in AI. Now, the data lake
    concept is popular to organize and train ML models in one place, but
    ML already requires distributed learning frameworks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL is a great way to distribute a training process over multiple
    nodes. As shown in many research reports, most data is not fully
    used to extract insights into ML models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are some companies and projects that are trying to use FL as a
    powerful distributed learning technique, such as the platforms
    provided by Devron (<a href="https://devron.ai/">[devron.ai]{.underline}</a>),
    FedML (<a href="https://fedml.ai/">[fedml.ai]{.underline}</a>), and STADLE
    (<a href="https://stadle.ai/">[stadle.ai]{.underline}</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These platforms are already resolving the issues discussed in <em>The
    limitation of centralized AI</em> section and have shown a drastic
    improvement in the ML process in various use cases, as stated in
    the <em>Revisiting the benefits of FL</em> section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the AI trends that we have discussed, let's look into the
    ongoing research and developments related to FL that cutting-edge
    companies are conducting now in the next section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ongoing research and developments in FL</p>
<ul>
<li>We now talk about the ongoing research and development projects that
    are being taken place both in academia and industries around the
    world. Let's start with the different types and approaches of FL,
    and move on to ongoing efforts to further enhance the FL framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exploring various FL types and approaches</p>
<ul>
<li>In this work, we have visited the most basic algorithms and design
    concepts of an FL system. In the real world, we need to dig a bit
    deeper into what types of FL frameworks are available to extract the
    best performance out of those algorithms. Depending on the data
    scenario and use cases, we have several approaches in FL, as
    follows:</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-129-1" name="__codelineno-129-1" href="#__codelineno-129-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Horizontal FL and vertical FL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Centralized FL and decentralized FL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cross-silo FL and cross-device FL</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-130-1" name="__codelineno-130-1" href="#__codelineno-130-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   Now, let's look at each type of FL in the following sections.</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal FL and vertical FL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Horizontal FL</strong> uses datasets with the same feature space or
    schema across all distributed devices
    (<a href="https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1902.04885/">[https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1902.04885/]{.underline}</a>).
    This actually means that datasets share the same columns with
    different rows. Most existing FL projects are based on horizontal
    FL. Datasets and training processes with horizontal FL are
    straightforward because the datasets are formed identically, with
    different data distributions and inputs to be learned. Horizontal FL
    is also called homogeneous or sample-based FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vertical FL</strong> is applied to the cases where different datasets
    share the same sample ID space but differ in feature space. You can
    check out this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.04309) for further
    information about vertical FL. Relating these different databases
    through FL can be challenging, especially if the unique ID for the
    data is different. The key idea of vertical FL is to improve an ML
    model by using distributed datasets with a diverse set of
    attributes. Therefore, vertical FL can handle the partitioned
    data vertically with different attributes in the same sample space.
    Vertical FL is also called heterogeneous or feature-based FL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Centralized FL and decentralized FL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized FL</strong> is currently the most common approach and most of
    the platforms employ this framework. It uses a centralized server to
    collect and aggregate the different ML models, with distributed
    training across all local data sources. In this book, we focused on
    a centralized FL approach, with a scenario where local training
    agents communicate the learning results to a centralized FL server
    to create a global model.</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-131-1" name="__codelineno-131-1" href="#__codelineno-131-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   <strong>Decentralized FL</strong>, on the other hand, does not use a
    centralized server to aggregate ML models. It requires individual ML
    models trained over local data sources to be communicated among
    themselves without a master node. In this case, model weights are
    transferred from each individual dataset to the others for further
    training. It could potentially be susceptible to model poisoning if
    an untrusted party could access the intelligence, and this is a
    common problem derived from peer-to-peer frameworks as well.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-132-1" name="__codelineno-132-1" href="#__codelineno-132-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   <strong>Cross-silo FL and cross-device FL</strong></p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-133-1" name="__codelineno-133-1" href="#__codelineno-133-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   <strong>Cross-silo FL</strong> is the case where ML models are trained on data
    distributed across any functional, organizational, and regulatory
    barriers. In this case, big data is usually stored in a larger size
    of storage, with training computing capabilities such as cloud
    virtual machines. In the cross-silo FL case, the number of
    silos/training environments is relatively small, so not so many
    agents are needed in the FL process.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-134-1" name="__codelineno-134-1" href="#__codelineno-134-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   <strong>Cross-device FL</strong> is the case where models need to be trained at
    scale, often within edge devices, such as mobile phones, <strong>Internet
    of Things</strong> (<strong>IoT</strong>) devices, Raspberry Pi-type environments, and
    so on. In this case, a huge number of devices are connected for the
    aggregation of ML models. In the cross-device FL case, the
    limitation basically lies in the low computing power of those edge
    devices. The framework also needs to handle a number of disconnected
    and inactive devices to conduct a consistent and continuous FL
    process. The training process and its data volume should be limited
    too.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-135-1" name="__codelineno-135-1" href="#__codelineno-135-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   That concludes the different types of FL that can be applied to a
    variety of scenarios in ML applications. There are new techniques
    that try to enhance the FL framework to evolve into the next
    generation of AI technologies with FL. Let's look into several
    advanced approaches in the next section.</p>
<p>Understanding enhanced distributed learning frameworks with FL</p>
<ul>
<li>There are ongoing efforts to further enhance FL or distributed
    learning frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Split learning</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Split learning</strong>, developed in the MIT Media Lab, is an
    emerging distributed learning technique that enables partitioning ML
    models into multiple sections, trains those partitioned ML models at
    distributed clients, and aggregates them at the end. Split learning
    does not have to share the data either, so it is considered a
    privacy-preserving AI as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall framework is similar to the FL. However, there is a
    difference in that the neural network is partitioned into multiple
    sections that will be trained on distributed clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trained weights of the section of the neural network are then
    transferred to the server and clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The weights of those multiple sections are continuously trained in
    the next training sessions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, no raw and private data is shared among the distributed
    clients, and only the weights of each section are sent to the next
    client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Especially, <strong>SplitFed</strong> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12088">[https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12088]{.underline}</a>)
    is another advanced technique that combines split learning and FL.
    SplitFed splits the deep neural network architecture between the FL
    clients and servers to realize a higher level of privacy than FL. It
    offers better efficiency than split learning based on the parallel
    learning paradigm of FL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Swarm learning</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Swarm learning</strong> is a decentralized ML solution built on
    blockchain technology, particularly designed to enable enterprise
    industries to take advantage of the power of distributed data, which
    results in protecting data privacy and security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This can be achieved by individual nodes sharing parameters of ML
    models derived from the local data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parameters shared from the distributed clients are merged into a
    global model. The difference from the normal FL is that the merge
    process is not performed by a central server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distributed nodes and clients choose a temporary leader to
    perform the merge. That is why swarm learning is truly
    decentralized, also providing greater fault tolerance and
    resiliency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distributed agents have the collective intelligence of a network
    without sharing local data into one node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swarm learning builds on top of blockchain. Blockchain provides the
    decentralized control, scalability, and fault-tolerance aspects to
    work beyond the restrictions of a single enterprise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, blockchain introduces a tamperproof cryptocurrency
    framework, and the participants can use the framework to monetize
    their contributions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>BAFFLE</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition, there is a framework called <strong>BAFFLE</strong> that stands
    for <strong>Blockchain Based Aggregator Free Federated
    Learning</strong> (https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07452). BAFFLE is also
    an aggregator-free, blockchain-driven FL framework that is
    inherently decentralized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BAFFLE utilizes <strong>Smart Contracts</strong> (<strong>SCs</strong>) from the blockchain
    framework to coordinate round management, as well as model
    aggregation and updating tasks of FL. Using BAFFLE boosts
    computational performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The global model is also decomposed into many sets of chunks,
    directly handled by the SC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that we have learned about the latest research and developments
    in the FL field, in the next section, let's look at a more visionary
    aspect of the AI, science, and technologies of collective
    intelligence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Journeying on to collective intelligence</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Big data has been a game changer for the AI movement. While the
    amount of data generated at the edge and by people will increase
    exponentially, intelligence derived from that data benefits society.
    Therefore, the big data era will gradually pass the baton to the
    collective intelligence era, empowered by FL, in which people will
    collaboratively create a wisdom-driven world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's start by defining an intelligence-centric era where the
    concept of collective intelligence is realized based on FL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Intelligence-centric era with collective intelligence</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Collective Intelligence</strong> (<strong>CI</strong>) is the concept of a large group
    of single entities acting together in ways that seem intelligent. CI
    is an emergent phenomenon where groups of people process information
    to achieve insights that are not understandable by just individual
    members alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recently, Thomas Malone, the head of the MIT Center for Collective
    Intelligence, and the person who initially coined the
    phrase <em>collective intelligence</em>, broadened the definition of
    CI: <em>"CI is something that can emerge from a group that includes
    people and computers. CI is a very general property, and superminds
    can arise in many kinds of systems, although the systems I've mostly
    talked about are those that involve people and
    computers"</em> (Reference: <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/xe/en/insights/focus/technology-and-the-future-of-work/human-and-machine-collaboration.html">[https://www2.deloitte.com/xe/en/insights/focus/technology-and-the-future-of-work/human-and-machine-collaboration.html]{.underline}</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are now welcoming the new perspective of CI in technologies
    empowered by FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data, in the current world of technology, is a great source to
    extract intelligence. Dispersed datasets around the world can be
    converted into a collection of intelligence represented by AI
    technologies. The current trend, as mentioned, is big data, so big
    data companies are leading not only the technology industries but
    also the entire economy of the world as well. The future is moving
    in a CI direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vision of CI is even clearer with the emergence of sophisticated
    ML algorithms, including deep learning, as the intelligence
    represented by ML models can extract intelligence from people,
    computers, or any devices that generate meaningful data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does FL promote the idea of CI? The nature of FL is to collect a
    set of distributed intelligence to be enhanced by an aggregating
    mechanism as discussed in this book. This itself enables a data-less
    platform that does not require collecting data from people or
    devices directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the big data issues discussed throughout the book, we have
    steered clear of focusing on data-centric platforms. However, it is
    also true that learning big data is very much critical and
    inevitable to really create systems and applications that are truly
    valuable and deliver real value in many domains of the world. That
    is why the big data field is still the most prosperous industry,
    even if it is facing significant challenges represented by privacy
    regulations, security, data silos, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now is the time to further develop and disseminate the technologies
    such as FL that can accelerate the era of CI by fundamentally
    resolving the issues of big data. This way, we can realize a new era
    of technologies, truly driven by CI that has been backed up by an
    authentic mathematical basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As mentioned, <em>data-centric</em> platforms are the current trend. So
    many data and auto ML vendors can support and automate the processes
    of creating ML-based intelligence by organizing data and learning
    procedures to do so.
    An <em>intelligence-centric</em> or <em>model-centric</em> platform should be the
    next wave of technology in which people can share and enhance
    intelligence that they generate on their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With FL, we can even realize crowd-sourced learning, where people
    can collaboratively and continuously enhance the quality and
    performance of ML models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, FL is a critical and essential part of the
    intelligence-centric platform to truly achieve a
    wisdom-driven world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Internet of Intelligence</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The IoT evolved into the <strong>Internet of Everything</strong>. However,
    what is the essential information that people want? Is it just big
    data? Or intelligence derived from data? With 5G technologies, a lot
    of data can be transferred over the Internet at a much higher speed,
    partially resolving the latency issues in many AI applications. FL
    can exchange less information than raw data but still needs to
    transfer ML models over the Internet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While lots of research projects are minimizing communications
    latency in FL, in the future, information related to intelligence
    will be another entity often exchanged over the web. There will be a
    model repository such as <strong>Model Zoo</strong> everywhere, and crowdsourced
    learning empowered by FL will be more common to create better
    intelligence over the Internet with people worldwide
    collaboratively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This paradigm shift is not just in the AI field itself but also in
    the wide range of information technologies. As we'll discuss in the
    next sections, this <strong>Internet of Intelligence</strong> movement will be
    the basis of crowdsourced learning and CI, and will help make
    intelligence available to as many people as possible in the coming
    years.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Crowdsourced learning with FL</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>collection of intelligence</em> performed by FL naturally makes it
    a strong fit for moving toward CI. The same thing is applied to a
    scenario where people can collectively contribute a training process
    to global ML models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High-performing ML models in areas such as computer vision and
    natural language processing have been trained by certain big data
    companies, often spending a huge amount of money, including hundreds
    of millions of dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there any way to collectively train an ML model that will
    probably be beneficial for a wide range of people in general? With
    the advanced framework of FL, that is possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL provides an authentic way to manage the aggregation of multiple
    trained models from various distributed agents. In this case, the
    distributed agents themselves may be people worldwide, where each
    individual user and trainer of the ML model has their own unique
    datasets that are not available to anybody else because of data
    privacy, silos, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This way of utilizing CI is often called <em>crowdsourced learning</em>.
    However, traditional crowdsourced learning is conducted in a much
    more limited way, just based on facilitating and recruiting data
    annotators at a large scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With this new paradigm with FL, users on the CI platform can access
    and download ML models that they are interested in and retrain them
    if necessary to absorb learning in their own environments. Then,
    with the framework to share the trained ML models by those users, an
    advanced aggregation framework of FL could pick up the appropriate
    models to be federated and make the global model perform better,
    adopting diverse data that can be only accessible to the users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This way, intelligence by ML is becoming more available to many
    individuals in general, not just to specific companies that have a
    significant amount of data and budgets to train an authentic ML
    model. In other words, without an FL framework, collaborative
    learning is difficult and tricky and almost impossible to even
    automate. This openness of the ML models will move the entire
    technological world to the next level, and a lot more
    applications will become feasible, with truly powerful intelligence
    that is trained by enthusiasts to make the world better.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this final section of the book, we discussed fascinating future
    trends and developments in which FL is expected to play a crucial
    role in the coming decade. In the future, FL is
    a <em>must-to-have</em> technology from a <em>nice-to-have</em> framework for most
    enterprises and application providers, because of the inevitable
    privacy regulations and technology trends requiring scalability with
    so many users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we discussed, future technologies will be empowered by the
    concept of the Internet of Intelligence, by which people and
    computers mainly exchange their wisdom altogether to create a more
    intelligent society and world. Finally, the data-centric
    technologies will gradually evolve into intelligence-centric
    technologies because of the current collaborative learning trend
    with CI, which makes people pay significant attention to FL-related
    technologies, whose foundations are discussed throughout this book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This book was written at the dawn of a new age in advancements made
    possible by AI. There are many uncertainties and many more
    challenges ahead. We have made great strides in utilizing the big
    data playbook in the last couple of decades, and we have now
    outgrown those methods and must adopt new ways of doing things, new
    technologies, and new ideas to forge ahead. As long as we capture
    the current moment and invest in new technologies such as FL, we
    will have a bright future ahead of us.</p>
