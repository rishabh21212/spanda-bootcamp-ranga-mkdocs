<p>[Knowledge graphs are a specific implementation of a Graph Database,
where information is captured and integrated from many different
sources, representing the inherent knowledge of a particular
domain.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[They provide a structured way to represent entities, their attributes,

understanding of the information within that domain.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Knowledge graphs break down sources of information and integrate them,
allowing you to see the relationships between the data.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[You can tailor knowledge graphs for semantic search, data retrieval,

<h2 id="large-language-models-generative-aimark"><strong>[Large Language Models &amp; Generative AI]{.mark}</strong></h2>
<p>[Large Language Models, referred to as LLMs, learn the underlying
structure and distribution of the data and can then generate new samples
that resemble the original data.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and
generate human-like text. LLMs can answer questions, create content, and
assist with various linguistic tasks by leveraging patterns learned from
the data.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Generative AI is a class of algorithms and models that can generate new
content, such as images, text, or even music. New content is generated
based on user prompting, existing patterns, and examples from existing
data.]{.mark}</p>
<h1 id="what-are-llmsmark"><strong>[What are LLMs?]{.mark}</strong></h1>
<p>[LLMs or Large Language Models is a type of generative AI that has been
trained on a massive scale of data (petabytes of data) and can produce
novel responses to any type of question, that's why the name generative.
These models are based on the Transformer architecture and require very
big GPU-based data centers. FYI, it took around 100 million USD to train
ChatGPT. These models are massive, they can't fit on any single server;
their parameter counts go in the order of trillions.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[One way to think about these models is to consider them as an
idea-generation machine. They can generate or give an approximate answer
to any textual query, even if it has not seen similar stuff in the past.
Given the size of the model data, these models have somehow captured the
essence of language, in some cases they even learned languages that were
not even part of the training data.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Some of you may ask, how is this possible? This is called Emergent
capabilities. It has been shown in research that these models might
develop completely new capabilities and capacities as we increase their
size.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Note: There are some doubts about LLMs\' emergent capabilities as
well.]{.mark}</p>

here</a>]{.mark}</p>
<h1 id="types-of-llmsmark"><strong>[Types of LLMs]{.mark}</strong></h1>
<p>[Currently, we have three types of LLMs:]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Closed Source: Models like ChatGPT or GPT-4 can only be accessed as a
service through the API provided by OpenAI.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Open Source, closed architecture: Like Llama 2, the weight files of
these models are open-sourced, meaning we can run them locally, and use
them to train smaller models, but their architecture is still not
public.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Fully open source: T5, BERT, and GPT-2 are a few of the fully
open-sourced models, having both their weights and architecture
open-sourced.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Compared to Fully open-sourced models, Closed or partial Open-source
models are much bigger in size.]{.mark}</p>
<p><strong>[But, what exactly are these models, how do they look like, and what
is their structure?]{.mark}</strong></p>
<p>[If we talk about models like Llama 2, 70B, it is a model with 70
billion parameters. There are two files that we need to use this model.
A weight file or parameter file (140 GB of basic matrices) and a
500-line C code that run these weights or parameter files.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[The reason why the parameter file is 140 GB is because the precision of
weight matrices is Float16, which means 2 bytes, meaning 140 GB for a 70
billion parameters model.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[These two files are completely self-contained packages, we don't need
anything else, just compile the C code that points towards this
parameter file and we are good to go to generate text on any kind of
question locally (without internet or anything).]{.mark}</p>
<p><strong>[Running LLMs on your Laptop:]{.mark}</strong></p>
<p>[LM Studio is a free, desktop software tool that makes installing and
using open-source LLM models extremely easy.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Here's how to use it:]{.mark}</p>
<p>[1. Go to "lmstudio.ai":]{.mark}</p>
<p>[2. Download and install the version for your operating system:]{.mark}</p>

<p>[3. Open LM Studio using the newly created desktop icon:]{.mark}</p>
<p>[4. Select an LLM to install. (1) You can do this by either selecting
one of the community suggested models listed in the main window, or (2)
by using the search bar for any model available at HuggingFace (just
look up a keyword and all associated models will be listed). Note that
there are currently 371,692 models listed at HuggingFace.co:]{.mark}</p>
<p><img alt="" height="4.097222222222222in" src="../media/media/image50.png" width="6.5in" /></p>
<p>[selecting LLMs]{.mark}</p>
<p>[5. Whether you elect to download from the community suggested models,
or search for one on your own, you can see the size of the
install/download file. So be sure you are okay with the size of the
download.]{.mark}</p>
<p><img alt="" height="4.152777777777778in" src="../media/media/image63.png" width="6.5in" /></p>
<p>[specific model information]{.mark}</p>
<p>[You will note that at the top of the left half of the screen over the
release date column, is "compatibility guess". LM Studio has checked
your system and is presenting those models which it feels you will be
able to run on your computer. To see All Models, click on "compatibility
guess" (#1). Clicking on a model on the left, will present the available
versions on the right and display those models which should work given
your computer's specs (#2).]{.mark}</p>
<p><img alt="" height="3.138888888888889in" src="../media/media/image32.png" width="6.5in" /></p>
<p>[Compatibility and Should Work indicators]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Note that depending on the capabilities/speed of your computer, larger
models will be more accurate but slower. You will also find that most of
these models are quantized.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[A little explanation about quantization. Quantization refers to using
lower precision numbers like 8-bit integers rather than 32-bit floating
point values to represent the weights and activations in the model. This
reduces memory usage and speeds up inference on your computer's
hardware. Quantization can reduce model accuracy slightly compared to a
full precision version, but provides up to 4x memory savings and faster
inference. Think of it like how MP-3's are compressed music files or
.jpgs are compressed image files. Although these are of less quality,
you often won't see a significant difference. In the case of LLM's, the
"Q" number you see in the listing of the LLM, represents the amount of
quantization. Lower is more and higher is less quantization.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Also, in the model listing, you will see references to GGML and GGUF.
Don't worry about it. These are two quantization strategies; "Mixed
Logits" vs "Uniformly Quantized Fully Connected". GGML provides a more
flexible mixed-precision quantization framework while GGUF is
specifically optimized for uniformly quantizing all layers of
Transformer models. GGML may enable higher compression rates but GGUF
offers simpler deployment.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[6. Once the model has finished its download, (1) select the model from
the drop-down menu at the top of the window; (2) select the chat bubble
in the left side column; (3) open up the following sections on the
right, "Context Overflow Policy" and "Chat Appearance".]{.mark}</p>

<p>[8. Now close those two areas and open up "Model Configuration" and then
open "Prompt Format" and scroll down to "Pre-prompt / System prompt" and
select the "&gt;" symbol to open that. Here you can enter the system
"role". Meaning, you can set up how you want the bot to act and what
"skills" or other specific qualities should be provided in its answers.
You can modify what is there to suit your needs. If you have a ChatGPT

<p>[9. Continue to scroll down in this column until you come to "Hardware
Settings". Open this area if you wish to offload some processing to your
GPU. The default is to allow your computer's CPU to do all the work, but
if you have a GPU installed, you will see it listed here. If you find
the processing of your queries is annoyingly slow, offloading to your
GPU will greatly assist with this. Play around with how many layers you
want it to handle (start with 10--20). This really depends on the model
and your GPU. Leaving it all to be handled by the CPU is fine but the
model might run a bit slow (again... depending on the model and its
size). You also have the option to increase the number of CPU threads
the LLM uses. The default is 4 but you can increase the number, or just
leave it where it is if you don't feel comfortable experimenting and
don't know how many threads your CPU has to play with.]{.mark}</p>

<p>[Model training is not as straightforward as Model Inference, for
inference we can use a local machine with a decent GPU, but training
LLMs is massively expensive.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Llama 2, which has around 10 TB of training data, was gathered by
crawling all over the internet. It needed 6000 GPUs running for 12 days
costing 2 Million USD to train it.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Basically, it compressed this huge chunk of internet (10 GB) into a 140
GB of parameter file. You can think of it as zipping the internet into a
single file but with one big difference, it is a lossy compression,
unlike lossless compression of zipping.]{.mark}</p>

<p>[Just so you know, the current SOTA in LLMs is maybe 10 or even 100
times bigger than this.]{.mark}</p>
<p><strong>[But why are we calling training of LLMs as compression of the
internet?]{.mark}</strong></p>
<p>[The simplest way to understand LLMs is that they are the next word
prediction machine, and it can be mathematically shown that predicting
the next word is very similar to compressing that data.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Compression is not the only way to think about LLMs, we can also think
about it as finding the conditional probability, predicting the next
token (token can be thought of similar to a word) given a sequence of
words, like in the below example, finding the probability of predicting
<strong><em>store,</em></strong> given <strong><em>I went to the</em></strong>. LLMs can be thought of as a
model that learns all these conditional probabilities.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[However, this view of conditional probability is very simplistic, and a
lot of researchers don't agree with that. For instance, Illya Sutskever
(creator of ChatGPT) thinks that in order to predict the next words,
these models have built internal world models like humans do to
understand concepts.]{.mark}</p>

<p>[<strong>But how?</strong> He believes that since the internet is a representation of
human experience, and these models are being trained on massive amounts
of data, somehow these models have built a detailed understanding of
abstract concepts. That's why they have shown the ability to score
better than humans in a lot of cases and even surpass the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test"><strong>[Turing

<p>[Illya's position is highly contested by other Scientists like VP of
META Yann LeCun. As of now, there is no consensus on how and why LLMs
are giving superb performance in some cases showing almost sentient
behavior and at times failing miserably to do even basic stuff.]{.mark}</p>

<p>[Since the LLMs are trained on raw internet text, they come across
different types of textual data. For instance, in the below diagram, we
can see the three different types of output <em>dreamed</em> by the network. If
you zoom in on the details of this, you will realize it is creating fake
ISBN numbers and that type of stuff. It has seen so much of that type of
data, so it thinks that whenever it says ISBN, it needs to be followed

<a href="https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/autoregressive-model"><strong>[autoregressive]{.underline}</strong></a>
types of models. These models do not produce the entire texts in one go,
but they predict one word at a time. Whatever word is predicted, that
word is also taken as input to predict the next words and this process
continues; it is summarized beautifully in the below diagram.]{.mark}</p>

<p>[<strong>Why are we saying that despite knowing how these models work, why are

<p>[For instance, if we ask these models, who is Elon Musk's mother? It
answers correctly, but when we ask "who is Maye Musk's (Elon's mother)
son?", it fails.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[And that's why we say we don't know what it learned.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[To understand in more detail this behavior of LLMs, there is a
completely new field emerging right now called Mechanistic
Interpretability.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Here's a series on <a href="https://medium.com/aiguys/decoding-ai-blackbox-mechanistic-interpretability-b64de4cbac91"><strong>[Mechanistic Interpretability
[4]]{.underline}</strong></a>.
Do check it out if you want to know the best research area in the
overall AI field.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Mechanistic interpretability in the context of DL involves delving into
the inner workings of these models to understand how individual
components contribute to overall behavior. To put it technically, we
want to elucidate the function of <strong>each neuron, layer, and pathway
within the network with respect to how they process inputs and affect
the final output.</strong>]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Simply put, we somehow need to reverse-engineer the weights of the
trained neural networks and convert them into a large binary file or
Python code that, later on, we can use to know the limits of what the
given model can't do. It's easier said than done; doing this is
extremely hard; even small models of a few layers forget about models
like GPT.]{.mark}</p>
<h1 id="training-an-assistantmark"><strong>[Training an Assistant]{.mark}</strong></h1>
<p>[What we talked till now is called pre-training, giving our models to
just predict document-like answers, but that's not what we want. We want
an assistant-like model.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Training LLMs have several components, the below diagram perfectly
summarizes the entire LLM training pipeline.]{.mark}</p>

<p>[So the use of the pre-training is to give a rough understanding of the
language to the world. It learned grammatical rules and other rules a
language might follow, but to make the network produce factually correct
and coherent answers, we do something called, <strong>Supervised
Fine-tuning.</strong>]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Supervised Fine-tuning is a very time-consuming process, where we get
actual people to write a set of questions and answers. We expose the
model to this human-written content, and by doing so, the model learns
to start behaving like an assistant.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[<strong>Note: The pre-training stage has much more data but of low quality,
compared to low volume and high-quality text of Supervised
Fine-tuning.</strong> This step makes the model behave more like an assistant
rather than producing entire documents. In short, it changes model
behavior from producing internet documents to question-answer
pairs.]{.mark}</p>

for humans to identify a good paragraph than write a good
paragraph.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[So this third stage is an optional stage, where we use the LLM itself
to generate multiple answers to the same question and then select the
best answers, mixed with some more edits with human data labelers, we
fine-tune the model even further to get it more accurate. The below

networks and keep getting better and more intelligent models.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[This theory has worked well till now, but that doesn't mean that it
can't hit the wall. It is very much possible that after a certain point,
accuracy will not be increased no matter how much we scale these
systems.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[A few scientists believe that we can't achieve AGI by just using LLMs

<p>[The field of LLMs is still evolving, there are a lot of cool, exciting,

risk, and my personal belief is that these models should not be released

we will try to get a more detailed look at what GPTs can and can't
do.]{.mark}</p>
<h3 id="instructing-an-llmmark"><strong>[Instructing an LLM]{.mark}</strong></h3>
<p>[The response generated by an LLM is a probabilistic continuation of the
instructions it receives. The LLM provides the most likely response
based on the patterns it has learned from its training data.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[In simple terms, if presented with the prompt <em>\"Continue this
sequence - A B C\"</em>, an LLM could respond <em>\"D E F\"</em>.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[To get an LLM to perform a task, you provide a prompt, a piece of text
that should specify your requirements and provide clear instructions on
how to respond.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[A user asks an LLM the question \'What is an LLM? Give the response
using simple language avoiding jargon.\']{.mark}</p>

height="2.7291666666666665in"}</p>
<p>[Precision in the task description, potentially combined with examples
or context, ensures that the model understands the intent and produces
relevant and accurate outputs.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[An example prompt may be a simple question.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[What is the capital of Japan?]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Or, it could be more descriptive. For example:]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Tell me about the capital of Japan.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Produce a brief list of talking points exploring its culture and
history.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[The content should be targeted at tourists.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Your readers may have English as a second language, so use simple terms

<p>[Avoid Jargon at all costs.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Return the results as a list of JSON strings containing content
formatted in Markdown.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[The LLM will interpret these instructions and return a response based
on the patterns it has learned from its training data.]{.mark}</p>
<h2 id="potential-problemsmark"><strong>[Potential Problems]{.mark}</strong></h2>
<p>[While LLMs provide a lot of potential, you should also be
cautious.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[At their core, LLMs are trained to predict the following word(s) in a
sequence.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[The words are based on the patterns and relationships from other text
in the training data. The sources for this training data are often the
internet, books, and other publicly available text. This data could be
of questionable quality and maybe be incorrect. Training happens at a
point in time, it may not reflect the current state of the world and
would not include any private information.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[LLMs are fine-tuned to be as helpful as possible, even if that means
occasionally generating misleading or baseless content, a phenomenon
known as hallucination.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[For example, when asked to <em>\"Describe the moon.\"</em> and LLM may respond
with <em>\"The moon is made of cheese.\"</em>. While this is a common saying,
it is not true.]{.mark}</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image44.png" />{width="3.125in"
height="1.3020833333333333in"}</p>
<p>[While LLMs can represent the essence of words and phrases, they don't
possess a genuine understanding or ethical judgment of the
content.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[These factors can lead to outputs that might be biased, devoid of
context, or lack logical coherence.]{.mark}</p>
<h2 id="fixing-hallucinationsmark"><strong>[Fixing Hallucinations]{.mark}</strong></h2>
<p>[Providing additional contextual data helps to <em>ground</em> the LLM's
responses and make them more accurate.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[A knowledge graph is a mechanism for providing additional data to an
LLM. Data within the knowledge graph can guide the LLM to provide more
relevant, accurate, and reliable responses.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[While the LLM uses its language skills to interpret and respond to the
contextual data, it will not disregard the original training
data.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[You can think of the original training data as the base knowledge and
linguistic capabilities, while the contextual information guides in
specific situations.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[The combination of both approaches enables the LLM to generate more
meaningful responses.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Throughout this course, you will explore how to leverage the
capabilities of Neo4j and Generative AI to build intelligent,

<h2 id="_3"></h2>
<p>There is no intelligence without knowledge. Despite the incredible power
of Large Language Models (LLM), they still significantly struggle with a
lack of domain knowledge, which can cause them to generate stale,
incomplete, or inaccurate responses. This shortfall presents one of the
biggest challenges for companies seeking to adopt domain-specific LLMs,
as it directly impacts the effectiveness and reliability of these models
in practical business scenarios.</p>
<h1 id="rag"><strong>RAG</strong></h1>
<p>To overcome this challenge, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10997">[Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG)]{.underline}</a> has emerged as the
most popular solution to provide LLMs with domain knowledge. With RAG,
we retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge base and
provide it to the LLM via the <a href="https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/elements">[context window of the
prompt]{.underline}</a>.
For example, if we want to ask a question about our employer's vacation
policy, we can use RAG to retrieve relevant HR policy documents from a
database and provide that information as context to the LLM.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image11.png" />{width="6.5in"
height="1.5277777777777777in"}</p>
<p>This RAG workflow is what I like to call: conceptually simple but
practically difficult.</p>
<p>The practical challenges of implementing RAG often manifest in the
nuances of data processing, selection, and integration. For a system to
effectively retrieve and utilize the right information, it must navigate
vast amounts of data sources with precision, understanding the context
and relevance of each piece of data.</p>
<h1 id="vector-database"><strong>Vector Database</strong></h1>
<p>While RAG significantly enhances the performance of LLMs, it relies
heavily on the sophisticated management and retrieval of data. This is
where vector databases come into play.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/">[vector
database]{.underline}</a>
indexes and stores <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-embeddings-for-developers/">[vector
embeddings]{.underline}</a>
for fast information retrieval via vector similarity search. The
embeddings are generated by AI models like LLMs and carry rich semantic
information that can be queried with a vector database. Typically, this
process involves converting a user's question into an embedding, then
using vector search to match it against <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/">[document text
chunk]{.underline}</a>
embeddings. The most relevant text chunks are retrieved based on high
vector similarity scores, calculated using metrics such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">[cosine
similarity]{.underline}</a>.</p>
<p>Taking our earlier example, the question <em>"Has the vacation policy
changed?"</em> can be transformed into a query embedding. We then run vector
similarity search against HR policy document embeddings to pinpoint
documents that are relevant to the vacation policy.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image48.png" />{width="6.5in"
height="2.9583333333333335in"}</p>
<p>Although RAG with a vector database stands as the established baseline
for providing LLMs with domain knowledge, it still faces critical
challenges that affect its overall effectiveness. The most common
challenges in practice include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Text Chunking Strategy:</strong> Determining the best way to chunk
    documents presents a significant hurdle. The size of each chunk must
    strike a delicate balance between providing sufficient detail and
    maintaining broader context. Larger chunks may offer more context
    but risk diluting specific, relevant information, whereas smaller
    chunks focus on details but might overlook essential contextual
    nuances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Top k Parameter:</strong> RAG with a vector database requires a <a href="https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/query-data">[top
    k]{.underline}</a> parameter
    to select how many text chunks are retrieved and fed into the LLM.
    Selecting an appropriate value for top k is complex; it is usually a
    fixed number, but its effectiveness varies depending on the text
    chunking strategy. If chunks are too small or lack adequate context,
    the LLM may not retrieve all necessary information for accurate
    response generation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Redundancy and Repetition:</strong> If text chunks contain similar
    information, we risk the issue of redundancy and repetition in the
    top k chunks retrieved. This redundancy not only hampers the
    diversity of the information provided to the LLM, but can also lead
    to skewed or unbalanced responses. Effective mechanisms to detect
    and mitigate such overlap are crucial in ensuring that the LLM
    receives a comprehensive and varied set of data for generating
    accurate and contextually rich answers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Query Understanding:</strong> The effectiveness of vector search is
    highly dependent on the semantic similarity between user queries and
    documents. Ambiguous or poorly formulated questions can lead to
    subpar retrieval results. This occurs because both questions and
    documents are represented as vectors in high-dimensional space, and
    a vague question may result in a vector that doesn't closely align
    with relevant document vectors. This <a href="https://jxnl.github.io/instructor/blog/2023/09/17/rag-is-more-than-just-embedding-search/">[query-document
    mismatch]{.underline}</a>
    phenomenon poses a significant challenge in ensuring accurate
    information retrieval.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to these common challenges, there is another nuanced aspect
and profound issue that often goes overlooked: <strong>vector similarity does
not satisfy the transitive property</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="vector-similarity-is-not-transitive"><strong>Vector Similarity Is Not Transitive</strong></h1>
<p>In vector space:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If vector <strong>A</strong> is similar to vector <strong>B</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And vector <strong>B</strong> is similar to vector <strong>C</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That does not mean vector <strong>A</strong> is similar to vector <strong>C</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The lack of transitivity has significant implications in how we
interpret and respond to queries in AI systems. When a user's query,
represented as vector <strong>A</strong>, seeks information that aligns with vector
<strong>C</strong>, the direct similarity might not be immediately apparent due to
the intermediary vector <strong>B</strong>. In essence, <strong>A</strong>'s connection to <strong>C</strong>
is indirect, mediated through its similarity to <strong>B</strong>.</p>
<p>This means that direct connections between query vectors and relevant
document vectors may be missed, potentially leading to gaps or
inaccuracies in the information retrieved. Understanding and addressing
this gap is an opportunity for the development of more effective and
nuanced AI-driven search and retrieval systems.</p>
<p>To illustrate this concept, consider a customer support scenario for a
mobile network provider:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image27.png" />{width="6.5in"
height="2.0694444444444446in"}</p>
<p>To demonstrate the non-transitive nature of vector similarity, we use
the <a href="https://huggingface.co/thenlper/gte-large">[gte-large]{.underline}</a>
embedding model to generate vector embeddings for question <strong>A</strong>,
document <strong>B</strong>, and document <strong>C</strong>. We then compute the cosine
similarity for each pair of vectors. The following table displays these
scores, offering a quantitative perspective on the relationships between
vectors A, B, and C.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image12.png" />{width="6.5in"
height="1.2777777777777777in"}</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Similarity of A to B:</strong> Customer asks a question <strong>A</strong>
    about frequent dropped calls at their home. This query aligns
    closely with document <strong>B</strong>, which mentions how network congestion
    can cause such problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Similarity of B to C:</strong> Document <strong>B</strong>, discussing network
    congestion, is closely related to document <strong>C</strong>. While document
    <strong>B</strong> outlines the issue, document <strong>C</strong> describes the telecom
    company's long-term solution, like the rollout of a 5G network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Indirect Similarity of A to C:</strong> Although document <strong>C</strong>, focusing
    on the 5G network rollout, may not seem to address the customer's
    immediate issue of dropped calls (question <strong>A</strong>), it is indirectly
    relevant. This document outlines long-term solutions that could
    ultimately resolve such connectivity issues. Understanding this
    indirect connection is key, as information about future network
    improvements provides valuable context and hope for resolving
    ongoing problems, despite not offering an immediate fix.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This example underlines the complexity of accurately mapping user
queries to the most relevant information. In developing AI systems,
particularly for customer support, it's crucial to consider not just
direct similarity but also the broader context and the ultimate utility
of the information to the user. Advanced algorithms and approaches that
account for these subtleties are key to enhancing the performance and
reliability of these systems.</p>
<p>Therein lies the question: how can we equip AI systems to effectively
discover and draw these nuanced connections, enabling them to connect
disparate dots of knowledge and provide comprehensive, contextually rich
answers?</p>
<h1 id="introducing-a-knowledge-vector-graph-connecting-the-dots-in-vector-space"><strong>Introducing a Knowledge Vector Graph: Connecting the Dots in Vector Space</strong></h1>
<p>We need a new RAG architecture that combines vector databases with graph

<p><img alt="" height="4.180555555555555in" src="../media/media/image19.png" width="6.5in" /></p>
<p>Imagine storing all pieces of information from your business documents
as nodes on a graph with edges connecting nodes to indicate their
relationship. Now when a user asks a question, we can run a two-stage
"vector graph" search operation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Node Vector Similarity Search:</strong> Search for relevant nodes within
    the graph based on vector similarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Graph Traversal:</strong> Start from the initially retrieved nodes and
    traverse the graph, taking multiple hops along the interconnected
    paths of knowledge to explore and retrieve additional, contextually
    linked nodes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At a high level, this is our solution to provide AI with complete domain
knowledge, helping AI connect disparate dots of knowledge to provide the
most useful answer.</p>

XML, we need to employ a simple Python script to extract the links.</p>
<p>import requests</p>
<p>import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET</p>
<p>URL =
\"https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2D2CMWXMOVWx7giW1n3LIg\"</p>

<h2 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Only a couple of months ago, most of us didn't realize that we will be
able to run LLMs on our laptop or free-tier Google Collab so soon. Many
RAG applications deal with private and confidential data, where it can't
be shared with third-party LLM providers. In those cases, using a local
embedding and LLM models as described here is the ideal solution.</p>
<p>https://github.com/tomasonjo/blogs/blob/master/weaviate/HubermanWeaviate.ipynb</p>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Using a Knowledge Graph to implement a DevOps RAG application</strong></p>
<p>RAG applications are all the rage at the moment.</p>
<p>Everyone is building their company documentation chatbot or similar.</p>
<p>Mostly, they all have in common that their source of knowledge is
unstructured text, which gets chunked and embedded in one way or
another.</p>
<p>However, not all information arrives as unstructured text.</p>
<p>Say, for example, you wanted to create a chatbot that could answer
questions about your microservice architecture, ongoing tasks, and more.</p>
<p>Tasks are mostly defined as unstructured text, so there wouldn't be
anything different from the usual RAG workflow there.</p>
<p>However, how could you prepare information about your microservices
architecture so the chatbot can retrieve up-to-date information?</p>
<p>One option would be to create daily snapshots of the architecture and
transform them into text that the LLM would understand.</p>
<p>However, what if there is a better approach? Meet knowledge graphs,
which can store both structured and unstructured information in a single
database.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image41.png" />{width="6.5in"
height="3.6666666666666665in"}[Knowledge graph schema representing
microservice architecture and their tasks.]{.mark}</p>
<p>Nodes and relationships are used to describe data in a knowledge graph.</p>
<p>Typically, nodes are used to represent entities or concepts like people,
organizations, and locations.</p>
<p>In the microservice graph example, nodes describe people, teams,
microservices, and tasks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, relationships are used to define connections between
these entities, like dependencies between microservices or task owners.</p>
<p>Both nodes and relationships can have property values stored as
key-value pairs.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image18.png" />{width="6.5in"
height="3.4583333333333335in"}[Node properties of a Microservice and
Task nodes. Image by author.]{.mark}</p>
<p>The microservice nodes have two node properties describing their name
and technology. On the other hand, task nodes are more complex.</p>
<p>They all have the name, status, description, as well as embedding
properties. By storing text embedding values as node properties, you can
perform a vector similarity search of task descriptions identical to if
you had the tasks stored in a vector database.</p>
<p>Therefore, knowledge graphs allow you to store and retrieve both
structured and unstructured information to power your RAG applications.</p>
<p>Here we will go through a scenario of implementing a knowledge graph
based RAG application with LangChain to support your DevOps team. The
code is available on
<a href="https://github.com/tomasonjo/blogs/blob/master/llm/devops_rag.ipynb?ref=blog.langchain.dev">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="neo4j-environment-setup"><strong>Neo4j Environment Setup</strong></h2>
<p>You need to set up a Neo4j 5.11 or greater to follow along with the
examples in this blog post. The easiest way is to start a free instance
on <a href="https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/?ref=blog.langchain.dev">Neo4j
Aura</a>,
which offers cloud instances of Neo4j database. Alternatively, you can
also set up a local instance of the Neo4j database by downloading the
<a href="https://neo4j.com/download/?ref=blog.langchain.dev">Neo4j Desktop</a>
application and creating a local database instance.from langchain.graphs
import Neo4jGraph.</p>
<p>from langchain.graphs import Neo4jGraph</p>

<h2 id="dataset"><strong>Dataset</strong></h2>
<p>Knowledge graphs are excellent at connecting information from multiple
data sources. You could fetch information from cloud services, task
management tools, and more when developing a DevOps RAG application.</p>

<p>Blue nodes describe microservices. These microservices may have
dependencies on one another, implying that the functioning or the
outcome of one might be reliant on another's operation. On the other
hand, the brown nodes represent tasks that are directly linked to these
microservices. Besides showing how things are set up and their linked
tasks, our graph also shows which teams are in charge of what.</p>
<h2 id="neo4j-vector-index"><strong>Neo4j Vector index</strong></h2>
<p>We will begin by implementing a vector index search for finding relevant
tasks by their name and description. If you are unfamiliar with vector
similarity search, let me give you a quick refresher. The key idea is to
calculate the text embedding values for each task based on their
description and name. Then, at query time, find the most similar tasks
to the user input using a similarity metric like a cosine distance.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image37.png" />{width="6.5in"
height="3.1944444444444446in"}[Vector similarity search in a RAG
application. Image by author.]{.mark}</p>
<p>The retrieved information from the vector index can then be used as
context to the LLM so it can generate accurate and up-to-date answers.</p>
<p>The tasks are already in our knowledge graph. However, we need to
calculate the embedding values and create the vector index. This can be
achieved with the from_existing_graph method.</p>
<p>import os</p>
<p>from langchain.vectorstores.neo4j_vector import Neo4jVector</p>
<p>from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings</p>
<p>os.environ[\'OPENAI_API_KEY\'] = \"OPENAI_API_KEY\"</p>
<p>vector_index = Neo4jVector.from_existing_graph(</p>
<p>OpenAIEmbeddings(),</p>
<p>url=url,</p>
<p>username=username,</p>
<p>password=password,</p>
<p>index_name=\'tasks\',</p>
<p>node_label=\"Task\",</p>
<p>text_node_properties=[\'name\', \'description\', \'status\'],</p>
<p>embedding_node_property=\'embedding\',</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>In this example, we used the following graph-specific parameters for the
from_existing_graph method.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>index_name: name of the vector index</p>
<p>node_label: node label of relevant nodes</p>
<p>text_node_properties: properties to be used to calculate embeddings
and retrieve from the vector index</p>
<p>embedding_node_property: which property to store the embedding
values to</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the vector index has been initiated, we can use it as any other
vector index in LangChain.</p>
<p>response = vector_index.similarity_search(</p>
<p>\"How will RecommendationService be updated?\"</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>print(response[0].page_content)</p>
<p># name: BugFix</p>
<p># description: Add a new feature to RecommendationService to provide
...</p>
<p># status: In Progress</p>
<p>You can observe that we construct a response of a map or dictionary-like
string with defined properties in the text_node_properties parameter.</p>
<p>Now we can easily create a chatbot response by wrapping the vector index
into a RetrievalQA module.</p>
<p>from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA</p>
<p>from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI</p>
<p>vector_qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(</p>
<p>llm=ChatOpenAI(),</p>
<p>chain_type=\"stuff\",</p>
<p>retriever=vector_index.as_retriever()</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>vector_qa.run(</p>
<p>\"How will recommendation service be updated?\"</p>
<p>)</p>
<p># The RecommendationService is currently being updated to include a new
feature</p>
<p># that will provide more personalized and accurate product
recommendations to</p>
<p># users. This update involves leveraging user behavior and preference
data to</p>
<p># enhance the recommendation algorithm. The status of this update is
currently</p>
<p># in progress.</p>
<p>One limitation of vector indexes, in general, is that they don't provide
the ability to aggregate information like you would with a structured
query language like Cypher. Take, for example, the following example:</p>
<p>vector_qa.run(</p>
<p>\"How many open tickets there are?\"</p>
<p>)</p>
<p># There are 4 open tickets.</p>
<p>The response seems valid, and the LLM uses assertive language, making
you believe the result is correct. However, the problem is that the
response directly correlates to the number of retrieved documents from
the vector index, which is four by default. What actually happens is
that the vector index retrieves four open tickets, and the LLM
unquestioningly believes that those are all the open tickets. However,
the truth is different, and we can validate it using a Cypher statement.</p>
<p>graph.query(</p>
<p>\"MATCH (t:Task {status:\'Open\'}) RETURN count(*)\"</p>
<p>)</p>
<p># [{\'count(*)\': 5}]</p>
<p>There are five open tasks in our toy graph. While vector similarity
search is excellent for sifting through relevant information in
unstructured text, it lacks the capability to analyze and aggregate
structured information. Using Neo4j, this problem can be easily solved
by employing Cypher, which is a structured query language for graph
databases.</p>
<h2 id="graph-cypher-search"><strong>Graph Cypher search</strong></h2>
<p>Cypher is a structured query language designed to interact with graph
databases and provides a visual way of matching patterns and
relationships. It relies on the following ascii-art type of syntax:</p>
<p>(:Person {name:\"Tomaz\"})-[:LIVES_IN]-&gt;(:Country
{name:\"Slovenia\"})</p>
<p>This patterns describes a node with a label Person and the name property
Tomaz that has a LIVES_IN relationship to the Country node of Slovenia.</p>
<p>The neat thing about LangChain is that it provides a
<a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/more/graph/graph_cypher_qa?ref=blog.langchain.dev">GraphCypherQAChain</a>,
which generates the Cypher queries for you, so you don't have to learn
Cypher syntax in order to retrieve information from a graph database
like Neo4j.</p>
<p>The following code will refresh the graph schema and instantiate the
Cypher chain.</p>
<p>from langchain.chains import GraphCypherQAChain</p>
<p>graph.refresh_schema()</p>
<p>cypher_chain = GraphCypherQAChain.from_llm(</p>
<p>cypher_llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name=\'gpt-4\'),</p>
<p>qa_llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0), graph=graph, verbose=True,</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>Generating valid Cypher statements is a complex task. Therefore, it is
recommended to use state-of-the-art LLMs like gpt-4 to generate Cypher
statements, while generating answers using the database context can be
left to gpt-3.5-turbo.</p>
<p>Now, you can ask the same question about how many tickets are open.</p>
<p>cypher_chain.run(</p>
<p>\"How many open tickets there are?\"</p>
<p>)</p>
<p><em>Result is the following</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image67.png" />{width="4.263888888888889in"
height="1.8194444444444444in"}</p>
<p>You can also ask the chain to aggregate the data using various grouping
keys, like the following example.</p>
<p>cypher_chain.run(</p>
<p>\"Which team has the most open tasks?\"</p>
<p>)</p>
<p><em>Result is the following</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image34.png" />{width="4.597222222222222in"
height="2.3472222222222223in"}</p>
<p>You might say these aggregations are not graph-based operations, and you
will be correct. We can, of course, perform more graph-based operations
like traversing the dependency graph of microservices.</p>
<p>cypher_chain.run(</p>
<p>\"Which services depend on Database directly?\"</p>
<p>)</p>
<p><em>Result is the following</em></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image42.png" />{width="6.5in"
height="1.5555555555555556in"}</p>
<p><em>\
</em>Of course, you can also ask the chain to produce <a href="https://graphaware.com/graphaware/2015/05/19/neo4j-cypher-variable-length-relationships-by-example.html?ref=blog.langchain.dev">variable-length path
traversals</a>
by asking questions like:</p>
<p>cypher_chain.run(</p>
<p>\"Which services depend on Database indirectly?\"</p>
<p>)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image66.png" />{width="6.5in"
height="1.6666666666666667in"}</p>
<p>Some of the mentioned services are the same as in the directly dependent
question. The reason is the structure of the dependency graph and not
the invalid Cypher statement.</p>
<h2 id="knowledge-graph-agent"><strong>Knowledge graph agent</strong></h2>
<p>Since we have implemented separate tools for the structured and
unstructured parts of the knowledge graph, we can add an agent that can
use these two tools to explore the knowledge graph.</p>

<p>from langchain.agents import AgentType</p>

<p>Let's try out how well does the agent works.</p>
<p>response = mrkl.run(\"Which team is assigned to maintain

<p>print(response)</p>
<p><em>Result is the following</em></p>

<p>One thing is certain. I have to work on my agent prompt engineering
skills. There is definitely room for improvement in tools description.
Additionally, you can also customize the agent prompt.</p>

<p><strong>Finally, a note on DPO</strong></p>
<h2 id="_4"></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The current gold standard to build LLM models is as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image38.png" />{width="6.5in"
height="2.611111111111111in"}</p>
<p><strong>Source: Chip Huyen</strong></p>
<p>You first assemble billions of documents with trillions of words and,
in a self-supervised manner, you ask the model to predict the next
token (word or sub-word) to a given sequence.</p>
<p>Self-supervised training is a training method where the supervisory
signal, the element that tells the model if it is correct or wrong, is
given by the training data without requiring human labeling.</p>
<p>In the case of ChatGPT, it is given by masking --- hiding --- the next
word, forcing a prediction, and comparing the word the model chose
with the actual masked word. Next, you want to teach the model to
behave in a certain way, like being able to answer questions when
prompted. That takes us to step 2, where we assemble a dataset where
the model performs the same exercise, but on a curated, dialogue-based
form, becoming what we define as <em>assistants</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[But we not only want the model to behave in a certain way, we also want
it to maximize the quality and safety of its responses.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Reinforcement Learning]{.mark} [from Human Feedback, or RLHF, steps 3
and 4, does exactly that, by teaching the model to not only answer as
expected but to give the best and safest possible answer aligned with
human preferences.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[However, there's a problem here.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Money goes brrrr]{.mark}</p>
<p>[RLHF involves three steps:]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Building a preference dataset. By prompting the model in step 2, they
build a dataset of {prompt, response 1, response 2}, where a group of
humans decides which response is better, 1 or 2.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Training a reward model. Step 3 in the previous diagram, you build a
model that learns to predict, for every new response, how good is it. As
you may imagine, we use the preference dataset to train this model, by
training it to assign a higher score to the preferred response out of
every pair.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Maximize reward. Finally, in step 4 of the diagram, we train the model
to maximize the reward. In other words, we train our model on a policy
that learns to obtain the highest rewards from the reward model. As this
model represents human preferences, we are implicitly aligning our model
to those human preferences.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[In layman's terms, you are training a model to find the ideal policy
that learns to take the best action, in this case word prediction, for
every given text.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Think of a policy as a decision-making framework, the model learns to
take the best action (word prediction) to a given state
(prompt).]{.mark}</p>
<p>[And that gives us ChatGPT. And Claude. And Gemini. But with RLHF, costs
get real.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Even though the first two steps before RLHF already consume millions of
US dollars, RLHF is just prohibitive for the majority of the world's
researchers, because:]{.mark}</p>
<p>[It involves building a highly curated dataset that requires extensive
model prompting and also the collaboration of expensive human
experts.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[It requires training an entirely new model, the reward model. This
model is often as big and as good as the model we are aligning, doubling
the compute costs.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[And it also involves running the soon-to-be-aligned model and reward
model in an iterative Reinforcement Learning training cycle.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Put simply, unless you go by the name of Microsoft, Anthropic, Google,
and a few others, RLFH is way out of your league.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[But DPO certainly isn't.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Keep it Simple, Stupid]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a mathematical breakthrough
where the trained model is aligned to human preferences without
requiring a Reinforcement Learning loop.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[In other words, you optimize against an implicit reward without
explicitly materializing that reward.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Without materializing a reward model.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[But before answering what the hell that means, we need to review how
models learn.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[It's just trial and error!]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Basically, all neural networks, be that ChatGPT or Stable Diffusion,
are trained using backpropagation.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[In succinct terms, it's no more than glorified trial and error.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[You define a computable loss that tells the model how wrong its
prediction is, and you apply undergraduate-level calculus to optimize
the parameters of the model to slowly minimize that loss using partial
derivatives.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[How do we actually optimize the model?]{.mark}</p>
<p>[In very simple terms, for every prediction, you compute the loss and
calculate the gradient of each parameter to that loss.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[A positive gradient for a parameter means increasing the value of the
parameter increases the loss, thus signaling us to reduce its value, and
viceversa.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[But what does this mean in the context of ChatGPT and other
LLMs?]{.mark}</p>
<p>[If we think about ChatGPT and its next token prediction task, as in
training we know what the predicted word should be, our loss function is
computed as the probability the model gives to the correct word out of
all the words in its vocabulary.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[If you're having trouble following, that's probably because I must
clarify that when we say that ChatGPT 'predicts the next word in the
sequence' what it's really doing is, out of the thousands of words in
its vocabulary, it is assigning a likelihood percentage to each word,
signaling how confident it is about that word being the most appropriate
to go next.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[In most cases, models simply choose the word with the highest assigned
probability, which goes by the name of 'greedy decoding'.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[For instance, the loss is quite big if we know the next word should be
"Cafe" and the model has only assigned a 10% probability to that
word.]{.mark}</p>

<p>[Source: \@akshar_pachaar (X.com)]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Consequently, the model slowly learns to assign the highest probability
possible to the correct word, thereby learning to efficiently model
language.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Therefore, looking at the earlier four-step diagram, in steps 1 and 2
the model learns just how we just explained, and in the case of RLHF,
the loss function essentially teaches the model to maximize a
reward.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Specifically, the loss function in RLHF looks something like
this:]{.mark}</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image47.png" />{width="6.5in"
height="0.5138888888888888in"}</p>
<p>[where the first term r(x,y) computes the reward given by the reward
model.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[And what about the subtracting term?]{.mark}</p>
<p>[The RLHF loss function also includes a regularization term to avoid the
model drifting too much from the original model.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[So, what makes DPO different from RLHF?]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Algebra comes to our aide]{.mark}</p>
<p>[The key intuition is that, unlike RLHF, DPO does not need a new model
--- the reward model --- to compute the alignment process.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[In other words, the Language Model you are training is secretly its own
reward model.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Now, what on Earth do we mean by that.]{.mark}</p>

height="1.3611111111111112in"}</p>
<p>[Source: Stanford]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Using clever algebra and based on the Bradley-Terry preference model
--- a probability framework that essentially predicts the best option
among a comparison of two possible options --- they implicitly define
the reward and train the LLM directly without requiring an explicit
reward model.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Although the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18290.pdf">DPO paper</a> gives
the complete mathematical procedure, the key intuition is that the
process goes from:]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Training an LLM » define a preference dataset » training a reward model
» training the LLM to find the optimal policy that maximizes the reward,
to:]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Training an LLM » define a preference dataset » training the LLM to
find the optimal policy.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[In other words, no reward model. But how do we compute then the reward
in DPO?]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Fascinatingly, the reward is implicitly defined as part of the optimal
policy.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[What DPO proves is that, when working with a human preference dataset,
we don't need to first create a reward model that predicts what a human
would choose and then use that model to optimize our goal model.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[In fact, we can do both steps in one by directly finding the optimal
policy that aligns with our model without calculating the actual reward.
This works because the optimal policy is a function of the reward,
meaning that by finding that policy we are implicitly maximizing the
reward.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Bottom line, you can think of DPO as a cool algebra trick that skips
calculating the reward explicitly by directly finding the policy that
implicitly maximizes the reward.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[This gives us the following loss function:]{.mark}</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image46.png" />{width="6.5in"
height="0.6527777777777778in"}</p>
<p>[Where yw and yl stand for the winning and losing response in a given
comparison.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[The intuition is that the higher the probability the policy gives to
the preferred response, and the lower the assigned probability to the
losing response, the smaller the loss.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Compared to the loss function used in RLHF we saw earlier, instead of
having our loss function as a function of a reward calculated by another
model, our loss function is a function of the optimal policy that
maximizes the reward without us having to actually compute that
reward.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Brilliant!]{.mark}</p>
<p>[2024, the Year of Efficiency]{.mark}</p>
<p>[We aren't even halfway through January and we have already seen the
disruption of one of the most painful and expensive, yet essential steps
in the creation of our best models.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Unequivocally, DPO levels the playing field, allowing universities and
small-time research labs to build models that can be aligned with orders
of magnitude lower costs.]{.mark}</p>

<p>[Companies in regulated industries need to have the ability to self-host
open-source LLM models to regain control of their own privacy.]{.mark}</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>[Since its arrival in November 2022,
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/?ref=plural.sh">ChatGPT</a> has revolutionized the
way we all work by leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to
streamline tasks, produce content, and provide swift and error-free
recommendations. By harnessing the power of this groundbreaking
technology, companies and individuals can amplify efficiency and
precision while reducing reliance on human intervention.\
\
At the core of ChatGPT and other AI algorithms lie <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/large-language-model-LLM?ref=plural.sh">Large Language
Models
(LLMs)</a>,
renowned for their remarkable capacity to generate human-like written
content. One prominent application of LLMs is in the realm of website
chatbots utilized by companies.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[By feeding customer and product data into LLMs and continually refining
the training, these chatbots can deliver instantaneous responses,
personalized recommendations, and unfettered access to information.
Furthermore, their round-the-clock availability empowers websites to
provide continuous customer support and engagement, unencumbered by
constraints of staff availability.\
\
While LLMs are undeniably beneficial for organizations, enabling them to
operate more efficiently, there is also a significant concern regarding
the utilization of cloud-based services like
<a href="https://openai.com/?ref=plural.sh">OpenAI</a> and ChatGPT for LLMs. With
sensitive data being entrusted to these cloud-based platforms, companies
can potentially lose control over their data security.]{.mark}</p>
<p>[Simply put, they relinquish ownership]{.mark} of their data. In these
privacy-conscious times, companies in regulated industries are expected
to adhere to the highest standards when it comes to handling customer
data and other sensitive information.\
\
In heavily regulated industries like healthcare and finance, companies
need to have the ability to self-host some open-source LLM models to
regain control of their own privacy. Here is what you need to know about
self-hosting LLMs and how you can easily do so with Plural.</p>
<h2 id="before-you-decide-to-self-host"><strong>Before you decide to self-host</strong></h2>
<p>In the past year, the discussion surrounding LLMs has evolved,
transitioning from \"Should we utilize LLMs?\" to \"Should we opt for a
self-hosted solution or rely on a proprietary off-the-shelf
alternative?\"</p>
<p>Like many engineering questions, the answer to this one is not
straightforward. While we are strong proponents of self-hosting
infrastructure -- we even self-host our AI chatbot for compliance
reasons -- we also rely on our Plural platform, leveraging the expertise
of our team, to ensure our solution is top-notch.</p>
<p>We often urge our customers to answer these questions below before
self-hosting LLMs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Where would you want to host LLMs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have a client-server architecture in mind? Or, something with
    edge devices, such as on your phone?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It also depends on your use case:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What will the LLMs be used for in your organization?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you work in a regulated industry and need to own your proprietary
    data?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does it need to be in your product in a short period?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have engineering resources and expertise available to build a
    solution from scratch?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you require compliance as a crucial feature for your LLM and have the
necessary engineering expertise to self-host, you\'ll find an abundance
of tools and frameworks available. By combining these various
components, you can build your solution from the ground up, tailored to
your specific needs.</p>
<p>If your aim is to quickly implement an off-the-shelf model for a RAG-LLM
application, which only requires proprietary context, consider using a
solution at a higher abstraction level such as OpenLLM, TGI, or vLLM.</p>
<h2 id="why-self-host-llms"><strong>Why Self-Host LLMs?</strong></h2>
<p>Although there are various advantages to self-hosting LLMs, three key
benefits stand out prominently.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Greater security, privacy, and compliance:</strong> It is ultimately the
    main reason why companies often opt to self-host LLMs. If you were
    to look at <a href="https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use?ref=plural.sh">[OpenAI's Terms of
    Use]{.underline}</a>,
    it even mentions that "We may use Content from Services other than
    our API ("Non-API Content") to help develop and improve our
    Services.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="" src="../media/media/image51.png" />{width="6.5in"
height="1.9583333333333333in"}OpenAI Terms of Use neglect a users
privacy.</p>
<p>Anything you or your <a href="https://www.cyberhaven.com/blog/4-2-of-workers-have-pasted-company-data-into-chatgpt/?ref=plural.sh">[employees upload into ChatGPT will be included in
future training
data]{.underline}</a>.
And, despite its attempt to anonymize the data, it ultimately
contributes knowledge of the model. Unsurprisingly, there is even a
conversation happening in the space as to whether or not <a href="https://theconversation.com/chatgpt-is-a-data-privacy-nightmare-if-youve-ever-posted-online-you-ought-to-be-concerned-199283?ref=plural.sh">[ChatGPT\'s
use of data is even
legal]{.underline}</a>,
but that's a topic for a different day. What we do know is that many
privacy-conscious companies have already begun to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-companies-issued-bans-restrictions-openai-ai-amazon-apple-2023-7?ref=plural.sh">[prohibit employees
from using
ChatGPT]{.underline}</a>.\
\
2. <strong>Customization:</strong> By self-hosting LLMs, you can scale alongside your
use case. Organizations that rely heavily on LLMs might reach a point
where it becomes economical to self-host. A telltale sign of this
occurring is when you begin to hit rate limits with public API endpoints
and the performance of these models is ultimately affected. Ideally, you
can build it all yourself, train a model, and create a model server for
your chosen ML framework/model runtime (e.g. tf,
<a href="https://pytorch.org/?ref=plural.sh">[PyTorch,]{.underline}</a> Jax.), but
most likely you would leverage a distributed ML framework like
<a href="https://www.plural.sh/applications/ray?ref=plural.sh">[Ray]{.underline}</a>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Avoid Vendor-Lock-In:</strong> When between open-source and proprietary
solutions, a crucial question to address is your comfort with cloud
vendor lock-in. Major machine learning services provide their own
managed ML services, allowing you to host an LLM model server. However,
migrating between them can be challenging, and depending on your
specific use case, it may result in higher long-term expenses compared
to open-source alternatives.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-llm-stack-to-self-host"><strong>Building a LLM stack to self-host</strong></h2>
<p>When building an LLM stack, the first hurdle you\'ll encounter is
finding the ideal stack that caters to your specific requirements. Given
the multitude of available options, the decision-making process can be
overwhelming. Once you\'ve narrowed down your choices, creating and
deploying a small application on a local host becomes a relatively
straightforward task.</p>
<p>However, scaling said application presents an entirely separate
challenge, which requires a certain level of expertise and time. For
that, you'll want to leverage some of the OS cloud-native
platforms/tools we outlined above. It might make sense to use
<a href="https://www.plural.sh/applications/ray?ref=plural.sh">[Ray]{.underline}</a>
in some cases as it gives you an end-to-end platform to process data,
train, tune, and serve your ML applications beyond LLMs.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bentoml/OpenLLM?ref=plural.sh">[OpenLLM]{.underline}</a>
is more geared towards simplicity and operates at a higher abstraction
level than Ray. If your end goal is to host a
<a href="https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/rag?ref=plural.sh">[RAG]{.underline}</a>
LLM-app using langchain and/or llama-index, OpenLLM in conjunction with
Yatai probably can get you there quickest. Keep in mind if you do end up
going that route you'll likely compromise on flexibility as opposed to
Ray.\
\
For a typical RAG LLM app, you want to set up a data stack alongside the
model serving component where you orchestrate periodic or event-driven
updates to your data as well as all the related data-mangling, creating
embeddings, fine-tuning the models, etc.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.plural.sh/marketplace?ref=plural.sh">[Plural
marketplace]{.underline}</a>
offers various data stack apps that can perfectly suit your needs.
Additionally, our marketplace provides document-store/retrieval
optimized databases, such as
<a href="https://www.plural.sh/applications/elasticsearch?ref=plural.sh">[Elastic]{.underline}</a>
or Weaviate, which can be used as vector databases. Furthermore, during
operations, monitoring and telemetry play a crucial role. For instance,
a Grafana dashboard for your self-hosted LLM app could prove to be
immensely valuable.</p>
<p>If you choose to go a different route you can elect to use a proprietary
managed service or SaaS solution (which doesn't come without overhead
either, as it would require additional domain-specific knowledge as
well.) Operating and maintaining those platforms on Kubernetes is the
main overhead you'll have.</p>
