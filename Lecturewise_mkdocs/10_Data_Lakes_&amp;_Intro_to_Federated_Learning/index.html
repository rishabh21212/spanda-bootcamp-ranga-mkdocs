  <h1>10 Data Lakes &amp; Intro to Federated Learning</h1>

<h2 id="section-12"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Section 12</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Data Lakes, Federated Learning and Big Data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data Lakes as a concept have played a key role in ushering in the
    massive scales we see when working with data today as they give
    companies the ability to store arbitrary types of data observed
    during operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While this freedom allows data lakes to maintain the maximum
    potential of the data generated by the company, it also can lead to
    a key problem---complacency in understanding the collected data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ease of storing different types of data in an unstructured
    manner can actually lead to a <em>store now, sort out later</em> mentality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The true difficulty of working with unstructured data actually stems
    from its processing; thus, the delayed processing mentality has the
    potential to lead to data lakes that become highly cumbersome to
    sift through and work with due to unrestricted growth from the
    collection of data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raw data is only as valuable as the models and insights that can be
    derived from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The central data lake approach leads to cases where derivation from
    the data is limited by a lack of structure, leading to issues
    ranging from storage inefficiency to actual intelligence
    inefficiency due to extraction difficulties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other side, approaches preceding data lakes suffered from a
    simple lack of access to the amount of data potentially available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that Federated Learning (FL) allows for both classes of
    problems to be avoided is the key driving support for FL as the
    vehicle that will advance big data into the collective intelligence
    era.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This claim is substantiated by the fact that FL flips the big data
    flow from collect → derive intelligence to derive intelligence →
    collect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For humans, intelligence can be thought of as the condensed form of
    large swaths of experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a similar way, the derivation of intelligence at the source of
    the generated data--- done by training a model on the data at the
    source location---succinctly summarizes the data in a format that
    maximizes accessibility for practical applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The late collection step of FL leads to the creation of the desired
    global intelligence with maximal data access and data storage
    efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even cases with partial usage of the generated data sources can
    still greatly benefit from the joint storage of intelligence and
    data by greatly reducing the number of data formats entering the
    residual data lake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abundance, Acceptance &amp; Ambivalence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While many definitions have been proposed with emphasis on different
    aspects, Oxford professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger and <em>The
    Economist</em> senior editor Kenneth Cukier brilliantly elucidated the
    nature of big data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not about how big the data in a server is; <em>big data is about
    three major shifts of a mindset that are interlinked and hence
    reinforce one another</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their argument can be summarized as the <strong><em>Triple-A mindset for big
    data</em>*, which consists of an </strong>Abundance of observations<strong>,
    </strong>Acceptance of messiness<strong>, and </strong>Ambivalence of causality***.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abundance of observations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Big data doesn't <strong><em>have</em></strong> to be <em>big</em> in terms of columns and rows
    or file size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big data has a number of observations, commonly denominated as <em>n</em>,
    close or equal to the size of the population of interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In traditional statistics, collecting data from the entire
    population---for example, people interested in fitness in New
    York---was not possible or feasible, and researchers would have to
    randomly select a sample from the population---for example, 1,000
    people interested in fitness in New York.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Random sampling is often difficult to perform and so is justifying
    the narrow focus on particular subgroups: surveying people around
    gyms would miss those who run in parks and practice yoga at home,
    and why gym goers rather than runners and yoga fans?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks to the development and sophistication of <strong>Information and
    Communications Technology</strong> (<strong>ICT</strong>) systems, however, researchers
    today can access the data of <em>approximately all of the population</em>
    through multiple sources---for example, records of Google searches
    about fitness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This paradigm of <em>abundance</em> or <em>n = all</em> is advantageous since what
    the data says can be interpreted as a true statement about the
    population, whereas the older methods could only <em>infer</em> such truth
    with a significant level of confidence expressed in a <em>p-value</em>,
    typically supposed to be under 0.05.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small data provides statistics; big data proves states.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Acceptance of messiness</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Big data is messy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we use Google search data as a proxy for someone's interest---for
    example---we could mistakenly attribute some of the searches made by
    their family or friends on their devices to them, and the estimated
    interest will be inaccurate to the degree of the ratio of such
    unowned-device searches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some devices, a significant amount of searches may be made by
    multiple users, such as shared computers at an office or a
    smartphone belonging to a child whose younger siblings are yet to
    own one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, people may search for words that pop up in a conversation
    with someone else, rather than self-talk, which does not necessarily
    reflect their own interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In studies using traditional methods, researchers would have to make
    sure that such devices are not included in their sample data because
    the <em>mess</em> can affect the quality of inference significantly, as the
    number of observations would be small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is not the case in big data studies. Researchers would be
    willing to <em>accept the mess</em> as its effect diminishes proportionally
    as the number of observations becomes large enough toward <em>n = all</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In most devices, Google searches would be made by the owner
    autonomously most of the time, and the impact of searches in other
    contexts would not matter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ambivalence of causality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Big data is often used to study <strong><em>correlation</em></strong> but not
    <strong><em>causation</em></strong>---in other words, it usually does not tell <em>why</em> but
    only <em>what</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For many practical questions, correlation alone can provide the
    answer. Mayer-Schönberger and Cukier give several examples in
    the <em>Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work,
    and Think</em> book, among which is Fair Isaac Corporation's <em>Medication
    Adherence Score</em> established in 2011.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an era where people's behavioral patterns are <em>datafied</em>,
    collecting <em>n = all</em> observations for the variables of interest is
    possible, and the correlation found among them is powerful enough to
    direct our decision-making. There is no need to know people's
    psychological scores
    of <em>consistency</em> or <em>conformity</em> that <em>cause</em> their adherence to
    medical prescriptions; by looking at how they behave in other
    aspects of life, we can directly predict whether they will follow
    the prescription or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By embracing the triple mindset of abundance, acceptance, and
    ambivalence, enterprises and governments have generated intelligence
    across tasks from pricing services to recommending products,
    optimizing transportation routes, and identifying crime suspects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nevertheless, that mindset has been challenged in recent years, as
    shown in the following sections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, let's glimpse into how the abundance of observations often
    taken for granted is currently under pressure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AI and Data Privacy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>FL is often said to be one of the most popular <strong><em>privacy-preserving
    AI technologies</em></strong> because <strong><em>private data does not have to be
    collected or shared with third-party entities to generate
    high-quality intelligence</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, in this section, we discuss the data privacy that has
    been a bottleneck that FL tries to resolve to create high-quality
    intelligence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data privacy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data privacy, also known as <em>information privacy</em>, is the <strong><em>right
    of individuals to control how their personal information is used,
    which mandates third parties to handle, process, store, and use such
    information properly in accordance with the law</em></strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In May 2021, HCA Healthcare announced that the company had
    struck a deal to share its patient records and real-time medical
    data with Google.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various media quickly responded by warning the public about the
    deal, as Google had been mentioned for its <em>Project
    Nightingale</em> where the tech giant allegedly exploited the
    sensitive data of millions of American patients.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given above 80% of the public believes that the potential risks in
    data collection by companies <strong><em>outweigh the benefits</em></strong>, according
    to a 2019 poll by Pew Research Center, data sharing projects of such
    a scale are naturally seen as a threat to people's <em>data privacy</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is often confused with <em>data security</em>, which ensures that data
    is accurate, reliable, and accessible only to authorized users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case of Google accounts, data privacy regulates how the
    company can use the account holders' information, while data
    security requires them to deploy measures such as password
    protection and <strong>2-step verification</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In explaining these two concepts, the data privacy managers use an
    analogy of a <em>window</em> for security and a <em>curtain</em> for privacy: data
    security is a prerequisite for data privacy. Put together, they
    comprise <em>data protection</em>, as shown in the following diagram:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 1.2 -- Data security versus data privacy
" src=".\images\/media/image80.jpg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1.2 -- Data security versus data privacy</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We can see from the preceding diagram that while data security
    limits <em>who</em> can access data, data privacy limits <em>what</em> can be in
    the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understanding this distinction is very important because data
    privacy can multiply the consequences of failures in data security.
    Let's look into how.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Privata Data Risks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Failing in data protection is costly. According to IBM's <em>Cost of a
    Data Breach Report 2021</em>, the global average cost of a data breach
    in the year marked <strong>US dollars</strong> (<strong>USD</strong>) $4.24 million, which is
    considerably higher than $3.86 million a year earlier and is
    the highest amount in the 17-year history of the report; an
    increased number of people working remotely in the aftermath of the
    COVID-19 outbreak is considered a major reason for the spike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The top five industries for average total cost are healthcare,
    finance, pharmaceuticals, technology, and energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nearly half of breaches in the year included customer <strong>personally
    identifiable information</strong> (<strong>PII</strong>), which costs $180 per record
    on average.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once customer PII is breached, negativities such as system downtime
    during the response, loss of customers, need for acquiring new
    customers, reputation losses, and diminished goodwill ensue; hence,
    the hefty cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The IBM study also found that failing to comply with regulations for
    data protection was top among the factors that amplify data breach
    costs
    (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/ojdvqgry">[https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/ojdvqgry]{.underline}</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Increased Data Protection Regulations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As technology advances, the need to protect customer data has become
    more critical. Consumers require and expect privacy protection
    during every transaction; many simple activities can risk personal
    data, whether online banking or using a phone app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governments worldwide were initially slow to react by creating laws
    and regulations to protect personal data from identity theft,
    cybercrime, and data privacy violations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, times are now changing as data protection laws are
    beginning to take shape globally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are several drivers for the increase in regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These include the growth of enormous amounts of data, and we need
    more data security and privacy to protect users from nefarious
    activities such as identity theft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's look at some of the <strong><em>measures taken toward data privacy</em></strong>
    in the following subsections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong>GDPR</strong>) by <strong>European
    Union</strong> is regarded as the first data protection regulation in the
    modern data economy and was emulated by many countries to craft
    their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GDPR was proposed in 2012, adapted by the EU Council and Parliament
    in 2016, and enforced in May 2018. It superseded the Data Protection
    Directive that had been adopted in 1995.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What makes GDPR epoch-making is its stress on the protection of PII,
    including people's names, locations, racial or ethnic origin,
    political or sexual orientation, religious beliefs, association
    memberships, and genetic/biometric/health information. Organizations
    and individuals both in and outside the EU have to follow the
    regulation when dealing with the personal data of EU residents.
    There are seven principles of GDPR, among which six were inherited
    from the Data Protection Directive; the new principle
    is <em>accountability</em>, which demands data users maintain documentation
    about the purpose and procedure of personal data usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GDPR has shown the public what the consequences of its violation can
    be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on the severity of non-compliance, the GDPR fine can go
    from 2% of global annual turnover or €10 million, whichever is
    higher, or 4% of global annual turnover or €20 million, whichever is
    higher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In May 2018, thousands of Europeans filed a complaint against
    Amazon.com Inc. through the French organization La Quadrature du
    Net, also known as <em>Squaring the Net</em> in English, accusing the
    company of using its advertisement targeting system without customer
    consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 3 years of investigation, Luxembourg's <strong>National Commission
    for Data Protection</strong> (<strong>CNDP</strong>) made headlines around the world: it
    issued Amazon a €746 million fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, WhatsApp was fined by Ireland's Data Protection
    Commission in September 2021 for GDPR infringement; again, the
    investigation had taken 3 years, and the fine amounted to €225
    million.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently, in the US, a majority of states have privacy protections
    in place or soon will. Additionally, several states have
    strengthened existing regulations, such as California, Colorado, and
    Virginia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's look at each to get an idea of these changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The state of California followed suit. The <strong>California Consumer
    Privacy Act</strong> (<strong>CCPA</strong>) became effective on January 1, 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the name suggests, the aim of the regulation is to protect
    consumers' PII just as GDPR does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compared to GDPR, the scope of the CCPA is significantly limited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CCPA is applicable only to for-profit organizations that collect
    data from over 50,000 points (residents, households, or devices in
    the state) in a year, generate annual revenue over $25 million, or
    make half of their annual revenue by selling such information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, CCPA infringement can be much more costly than GDPR
    infringement since the former has no ceiling for its fine ($2,500
    per record for each unintentional violation; $7,500 per record for
    each intentional violation).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Colorado Privacy Act (CPA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under the <strong>Colorado Privacy Act</strong> (<strong>CPA</strong>), starting July 1, 2024,
    data collectors and controllers will have to follow universal
    opt-outs that users have selected for generating targeted
    advertising and sales. This rule protects residents in Colorado from
    targeted sales and advertising as well as certain types of
    profiling.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virginia's <strong>Consumer Data Protection Act</strong> (<strong>CDPA</strong>) will make
    several changes to increase security and privacy on January 1, 2023.
    These changes will be applicable to organizations that do business
    in Virginia or with residents in Virginia. Data collectors need to
    obtain approval to utilize their private data. These changes also
    try to determine the adequacy of privacy and security of AI vendors,
    which may require the removal of that data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are just a few simple examples of how data regulations will
    take shape in the US. What does this look like for the rest of the
    world? Some estimate that by 2024, 75% of the global population will
    have personal data covered by privacy regulations of one type or
    another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another example of major data protection regulation is
    Brazil's <strong>Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais</strong> (<strong>LGPD</strong>)
    which has been in force since September 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It replaced dozens of laws in the country related to data privacy.
    LGPD was modeled after GDPR, and the contents are almost identical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Asia, Japan was the first country to introduce a data protection
    regulation: the <strong>Act on the Protection of Personal
    Information</strong> (<strong>APPI</strong>) was adopted in 2003 and amended in 2015. In
    April 2022, the latest version of APPI was put in force to address
    modern concerns over data privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>FL has been identified as a critical technology that can work
    well with privacy regulations and regulatory compliance in different
    domains.</em></strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data Minimalism</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Organizations have been acclimatizing to these regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TrustArc's <em>Global Privacy Benchmarks Survey 2021</em> found that the
    number of enterprises with a dedicated privacy office is increasing:
    83% of respondents in the survey had a privacy office, whereas the
    rate was only 67% in 2020. 85% had a strategic and reportable
    privacy management program in place, yet 73% of them believed that
    they could do more to protect privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their eagerness is hardly surprising as 34% of the respondents
    claimed that they had faced a data breach in the previous 3 years,
    the costly consequences of which was mentioned previously Here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A privacy office would be led by a <strong>data protection
    officer</strong> (<strong>DPO</strong>) who is responsible for the company's <strong>Data
    Protection Impact Assessment</strong> (<strong>DPIA</strong>) in order to comply with
    regulations such as GDPR that demand accountability and
    documentation of personal data handling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DPOs are also responsible for monitoring and ensuring that personal
    data is treated by their organizations in compliance with the law,
    and the top management and board are supposed to provide necessary
    support and resources to DPOs to allow them to complete their task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the face of GDPR, the current trend in data protection is
    shifting toward <em>data minimalism</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data minimalism in this context does not necessarily encourage
    minimization of the size of data; it pertains more directly to
    <strong><em>minimizing PII factors</em></strong> in data so that individuals cannot be
    identified with its data points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, data minimalism affects AI sectors in their ability to
    create a high-performing AI application because a shortage in data
    variety for the ML process simply generates ML model biases with
    unsatisfying performance in prediction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The abundance mindset for big data introduced at the beginning of
    the section has thus been disciplined by the public concern over
    data privacy. The risk of being fined for violating data protection
    regulations, coupled with the wasteful cost of having a data
    graveyard, calls for practicing data minimalism rather than data
    abundance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is why FL is becoming a <em>must-have</em> solution for many AI
    solution providers such as medical sectors that are struggling with
    public concerns and data privacy, which basically becomes an issue
    when a third-party entity needs to collect private data for
    improving the quality of ML models and their applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As mentioned, FL is a promising framework for privacy-preserving AI
    because learning of the data can happen anywhere; even if the data
    is not available for the AI service providers, all we have to do is
    collect and aggregate trained ML models in a consistent way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, let's consider another facet of the Triple-A mindset for big
    data being challenged: acceptance of messy data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data Volume, Training Data and Model Bias</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does the sheer volume of big data truly annihilate the treacherous
    reality of <em>garbage in, garbage out</em>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, the messiness of data can only be accepted if enough data
    from a variety of sources and distributions can be fully learned
    <strong><em>without causing any biases in the outcomes of the learning</em></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The actual training of the big data in a centralized location does
    take a lot of time and huge computational resources and storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, we would probably have to find methods to measure and reduce
    model bias without directly collecting and accessing sensitive and
    private data, which would conflict with some of the privacy
    regulations discussed previously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL also has an aspect of distributed and collaborative learning,
    which becomes critical to eliminate data and model bias to absorb
    the messiness of the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With collaborative and distributed learning, we could significantly
    increase the data accessibility and efficiency of an entire learning
    process that is often very expensive and time-consuming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It gives us a chance to break through the limitation that big data
    training used to have, as discussed in the following sections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Training Costs</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>According to the report:
    https://www.flexera.com/blog/cloud/cloud-computing-trends-2022-state-of-the-cloud-report,
    37% of enterprises annually spend more than $12 million and 80%
    spend over $1.2 million per year for public cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The training cost over the cloud is not cheap, and it can easily be
    assumed that this cost is going to boost significantly, together
    with the increasing demand for AI and ML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, big data cannot be fully trained for ML because of the
    following issues:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-0-1" name="__codelineno-0-1" href="#__codelineno-0-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   <strong>Big data storage</strong>: Big data storage is an architecture for
    compute and storage that collects and manages large amounts of
    datasets for AI applications or real-time analytics. Worldwide
    enterprise companies are paying more than $100 billion just for
    cloud storage and data center costs
    (https://a16z.com/2021/05/27/cost-of-cloud-paradox-market-cap-cloud-lifecycle-scale-growth-repatriation-optimization/).
    While some of the datasets are critical for the applications they
    provide, what they really want is often <strong>business
    intelligence</strong> that can be extracted from the data, not just the
    data itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Significant training time</strong>: Building and training an ML model
    that can be delivered as an authentic product basically takes a
    significant amount of time, not only for the training process but
    also for the preparation of the ML pipelines. Therefore, in many
    cases, the true value of the intelligence is going to be lost by the
    time the ML model is delivered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Huge computation</strong>: Training of an ML model often consumes
    significant computational resources. For example, an ML task of
    manipulating pieces such as a Rubik's Cube using a robotic hand
    could sometimes require more than 1,000 computers. It could also
    take a dozen machines just to run some specialized graphics chips
    for several months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communications latency</strong>: To form big data, especially in the
    cloud, a significant amount of data needs to be transferred to the
    server, which in itself causes communications latency. In most use
    cases, FL requires much less data to be transferred from local
    devices or learning environments to a server called an aggregator
    that is there to synthesize the local ML models collected from those
    devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>: In traditional centralized systems, scalability
    becomes an issue because of the complexity of big data and its
    costly infrastructures such as huge storage and computing resources
    in the cloud server environment. In an FL server, only an
    aggregation is conducted to synthesize the multiple local models
    that have been trained to update the global model. Therefore, both
    the system and learning scalability increase significantly as ML
    training is conducted on edge devices in a distributed manner, not
    only in a single centralized learning server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><a id="__codelineno-1-1" name="__codelineno-1-1" href="#__codelineno-1-1"></a>&lt;!-- --&gt;
</code></pre></div>
-   FL effectively utilizes distributed computational resources that can
    be used for light training of the ML models.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whether training happens on actual physical devices or virtual
    instances of the cloud system, parallelizing the model training
    process into distributed environments often accelerates the speed of
    learning itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, once the trained models are collected, the FL system
    can quickly synthesize them to generate an updated ML model called a
    global model that absorbs enough learnings at the edge sides, and
    thus delivering the intelligence in near real time is possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Model bias and training data</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ML bias happens when an ML algorithm generates results that are
    systemically prejudiced because of erroneous assumptions in the ML
    process. ML bias is also sometimes called algorithm bias or AI bias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yann LeCun, the 2018 Turing Award winner for his outstanding
    contribution to the development of DL, says "<em>ML systems are biased
    when data is biased</em>"
    (<a href="https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1274782757907030016">[https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1274782757907030016]{.underline}</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This comes from a <strong>computer vision</strong> (<strong>CV</strong>) model trained with
    the Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset compiled by the Nvidia team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the face upsampling system, many people are classified
    as white as the network was pre-trained on Flickr-Faces-HQ data
    mainly containing pictures of white people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For this problem of misclassification of the people, the
    architecture of the model is not the issue that mandates this
    output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence, the conclusion is that a racially skewed dataset generated a
    neutral model to produce biased outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Productive conversations about AI and ML biases have been led by the
    former lead of AI Ethics at Google.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 2018 publication of the <em>Gender Shades</em> paper demonstrated race
    and gender bias in major facial recognition models, and lawmakers in
    Congress have sought to prohibit the use of the technology by the US
    federal government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tech companies including Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft also agreed to
    suspend or terminate sales of facial recognition models to the
    police.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are encouraged to use an interventionist approach to data
    collection by advising scientists and engineers to specify the
    objectives of model development, form a strict policy for data
    collection, and conduct a thorough appraisal of collected data to
    avoid biases---details are available on the <em>FATE/CV</em> website
    (https://sites.google.com/view/fatecv-tutorial/home).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL could be one of the most promising ML technologies to overcome
    data-silo issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very often, the data is not even be accessible or usable for the
    training, causing a significant bias in data and models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Naturally, FL is useful for overcoming bias by resolving the issues
    of data privacy and silos that become the bottleneck to
    fundamentally avoiding data bias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this context, FL is becoming a breakthrough in the implementation
    of big data services and applications, as thoroughly investigated
    in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04160.pdf">[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04160.pdf]{.underline}</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, there are several techniques that try to mitigate model bias
    in FL itself, such as <em>Reweighing</em> and <em>Prejudice Remover</em>, both
    detailed
    in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02447.pdf">[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02447.pdf]{.underline}</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Model drift &amp; performance degradation</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Model drift</em> is generally about the degradation of ML model
    performance because of changes in data and relationships
    between <strong>input and output</strong> (<strong>I/O</strong>) variables, known as <em>model
    decay</em>, as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model drift can be addressed by continuous learning to adapt to
    the latest changes in datasets or environments in near real time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the important aspects of FL is realizing a continuous
    learning framework by updating an ML model instantly whenever the
    learning happens in the local distributed environment anytime, in a
    consistent manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That way, FL could resolve the situation often seen in enterprise AI
    applications where the intelligence is useless by the time it is
    delivered for production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will now touch on how models could get degraded or stop working,
    and then some of the current efforts of <strong>model
    operations</strong> (<strong>ModelOps</strong>) to continuously improve the performance
    of models and achieve sustainable AI operations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How models can stop working</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any AI and ML model with fixed parameters, or <em>weights</em>, generated
    from the training data and adjusted to the test data can perform
    fairly well when deployed in an environment where the model receives
    data similar to the training and test data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an autonomous driving model is well trained with data recorded
    during sunny daytime, the model can drive vehicles safely on sunny
    days because it is doing what it has been trained to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a rainy night, however, nobody should be in or near the vehicle
    if it is autonomously driven: the model is fed with totally
    unfamiliar, dark, and blurry images; its decisions will not be
    reliable at all. In such a situation, the model's decision will be
    far off the track, hence the name <strong>model drift</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, model drift is not likely to happen if the model is deployed
    in an environment similar to the training and testing environment
    and if the environment does not change significantly over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But in many business situations, that assumption does not always
    hold, and model drift becomes a serious issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are two types of model drifts: <strong>data drift</strong> and <strong>concept
    drift</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data drift happens when input data to a deployed model is
    significantly different from the data the model has been trained
    with. In other words, changes in <em>data distribution</em> are the cause
    of data drift. The aforementioned diurnal autonomous vehicle model
    not performing well in the nighttime is an example of data drift.
    Another example would be an ice-cream sale prediction model trained
    in California being deployed in New Zealand; seasonality in the
    southern hemisphere is opposite to that in the northern hemisphere,
    and the estimated sales of ice cream will be low for <em>summer</em> and
    high for <em>winter</em>, on the contrary to the actual sales volume.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concept drift, on the other hand, is a result of changes in how
    variables correlate with each other. In the terminology of
    statistics, this implies that the <em>data-generating process</em> has been
    altered. And this is what <strong>Google Flu Trends (GFT)</strong> suffered from,
    as the author of <em>The Undercover Economist</em> put it in the
    following <em>Financial Times</em> article:
    https://www.ft.com/content/21a6e7d8-b479-11e3-a09a-00144feabdc0#axzz30qfdzLCB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to the period, search queries were meaningfully correlated
    with the spread of flu as mainly people who suspected that they were
    infected typed those words in the browser, and therefore the model
    worked successfully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This may no longer have been the case in 2013 since people in other
    categories, such as those who were precocious about a potential
    pandemic or those who were just curious, were searching for those
    words, and they may have been led to do so by Google's
    recommendations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This concept drift likely made GFT overestimate the spread vis-à-vis
    medical reports provided by the <strong>Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention</strong> (<strong>CDC</strong>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either by data or by concept, model drift causes model performance
    degradation, and it occurs because of our focus on correlation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>ground truth</em> in data science parlance does not mean something
    like the universal truth in hard science such as physics and
    chemistry---that is, causation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is merely a true statement about how variables in given data
    correlate with each other in a particular environment, and it
    provides no guarantee that the correlation holds when the
    environment changes or differs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is to say that what we estimate as the <em>ground truth</em> can vary
    over time and locations, just like the <em>ground</em> has been reshaped by
    seismic events throughout history and geography.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Continuous monitoring</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a survey commissioned by Redis Labs
    (https://venturebeat.com/business/redis-survey-finds-ai-is-stressing-it-infrastructure-to-breaking-point/),
    about half of the respondents cited model reliability (48%), model
    performance (44%), accuracy over time (57%), and latency of running
    the model (51%) as the top challenges for getting models deployed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given the risk and concern of model drift, AI and ML model
    stakeholders need to work on two additional tasks after deployment.
    First, model performance must be continuously monitored to detect
    model drift. Both data drift and concept drift can take place
    gradually or suddenly. Once model drift is detected, the model needs
    to be retrained with new training data, and when concept drift
    occurs, even the use of a new model architecture may be necessary to
    upgrade the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to address these requirements, a new ML principle
    called <strong>Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning</strong> (<strong>CD4ML</strong>) has
    been proposed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the framework of CD4ML,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A model is coded and trained with training data in the first
    step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The model is then tested with a separate dataset and evaluated
    based on some metrics, and more often than not, the best model
    is selected from multiple candidates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, the selected model is productionized with a further test
    to make sure that the model performs well after the deployment,
    and once it passes the test, it is deployed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here, the monitoring process starts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When model drift is observed, the model will be retrained with
    new data or given a new architecture, depending on the severity
    of the drift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are familiar with software engineering, you might have
    noticed that CD4ML is the adoption of <strong>continuous
    integration/continuous delivery</strong> (<strong>CI/CD</strong>) in the field of
    ML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a similar vein, <em>ModelOps</em>, an AI and ML operational
    framework stemming from
    the <strong>development-operations</strong> (<strong>DevOps</strong>) software engineering
    framework is gaining popularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ModelOps bridges <strong>ML operations</strong> (<strong>MLOps</strong>: the integration
    of data engineering and data science) and application
    engineering; it can be seen as the enabler of CD4ML.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third factor of the <em>Triple-A mindset for big data</em> lets us
    focus on correlation and has helped in building AI and ML models
    rapidly over the last decade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding correlation is much easier than discovering causation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For many AI and ML models that have been telling us what we need to
    know from people's Google search patterns over years, we have to
    check if it still works today. And so do we tomorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is why FL is one of the important approaches for continuous
    learning. When creating and operating an FL system, it is also
    important to develop the system with ModelOps functionalities,
    as the critical role of FL is to keep improving models constantly
    from various learning environments in a collaborative manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is even possible to realize a <strong>crowdsourced learning</strong> framework
    with FL so that people in the platform can take the desired ML model
    to adapt and train it locally and return an updated model to the FL
    server with an aggregator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With an advanced model aggregation framework to filter out poisonous
    ML models that could potentially degrade the current models, FL can
    consistently integrate other learnings, and thus realize a
    sustainable continuous learning operation that is key for the
    platform with ModelOps functionalities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The FL Solution Approach</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We confirmed that big data has issues to be addressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data privacy must be preserved in order to protect not only
    individuals but also data users who would face risks of data
    breaches and subsequent fines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biases in a set of big data can affect inference significantly
    through proxies, even when factors about gender and race are
    omitted, and focus on correlation rather than causation makes
    predictive models vulnerable to model drift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let us discuss the difference between a traditional big data ML
    system and an FL system in terms of their architectures, processes,
    issues, and benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following diagram depicts a visual comparison between a
    traditional big data ML system and an FL system:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Figure 1.3 -- Comparison between traditional big data ML system and FL

<p>Figure 1.3 -- Comparison between traditional big data ML system and FL
system</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the traditional big data system, data is gathered to create large
    data stores. These large data stores are used to solve a specific
    problem using ML. The resulting model displays strong
    generalizability due to the volume of data it is trained on and is
    eventually deployed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, continuous data collection uses large amounts of
    communication bandwidth. In privacy-focused applications, the
    transmission of data may be banned entirely, making model creation
    impossible. Training large ML models on big data stores is
    computationally expensive, and traditional centralized training
    efficiency is limited by single-machine performance. Slow training
    processes lead to long delays between incremental model updates,
    leading to a lack of flexibility in accommodating new data trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, in an FL system, ML training is performed
    directly at the location of the data. The resulting trained models
    are collected at the central server. Aggregation algorithms are used
    to produce an aggregated model from the collected models. The
    aggregated model is sent back to the data locations for further
    training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FL approaches often incur overhead to set up and maintain training
    performance with distributed-system settings. However, even with a
    bit more complicated architecture and settings, there are benefits
    that exceed its complexity drawbacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training is performed at the data location, so data is never
    transmitted, maintaining data privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training can be performed asynchronously across a variable number of
    nodes, which results in efficient and easily scalable distributed
    learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only model weights are transmitted between server and nodes, thus FL
    is efficient in communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced aggregation algorithms can maintain training performance
    even in restricted scenarios and increase efficiency in standard ML
    scenarios too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vast majority of all AI projects do not seem to be delivered, or
    simply fall short altogether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To deliver an authentic AI application and product, all the issues
    discussed previously need to be considered seriously. It is obvious
    that FL, together with other key technologies to deal with local
    data processed by the ML pipeline and engine, is getting to be a
    critical solution to resolve data-related problems in a continuous
    and collaborative manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we harness the power of AI and ML to optimize the technical
    system for society in its entirety---that is, bring about a more
    joyous, comfortable, convenient, and safe world while being data
    minimalistic and ethical, as well as delivering improvements
    continuously?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We contend that the key is a <em>collective
    intelligence</em> or <em>intelligence-centric</em> platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In subsequent sections, we introduce the concept, design, and
    implementation of an FL system as a promising technology for
    orchestrating collective intelligence with networks of AI and ML
    models to fulfill those requirements discussed so far.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This section provided an overview of how FL could potentially solve
    many of the big data issues by first understanding the definition of
    big data and its nature, involving an abundance of observations,
    acceptance of messiness, and ambivalence of causality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have learned about privacy regulations in a variety of forms from
    many regions and the risk of data breaches and privacy violations
    that eventually lead to loss of profits, as well as a bottleneck in
    creating authentic AI applications. Federated learning, by design,
    will not collect any raw data and can preserve data privacy and
    follow those regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, with an FL framework, we can reduce inherent bias that
    affects the performance of ML models and minimize model drift with a
    continuous learning framework. Thus, a distributed and collaborative
    learning framework such as FL is required for a more cost-effective
    and efficient approach based on FL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This introductory section concluded with the potential of FL as a
    primary solution for the aforementioned big data problems based on
    the paradigm-shifting idea of collective intelligence that could
    potentially replace the current mainstream data-centric platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next section, we will see where in the landscape of data
    science FL fits and how it can open a new era of ML.</p>
</li>
